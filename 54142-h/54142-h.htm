<h2><i>PREFATORY LETTER.</i></h2>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">To Mrs. J. C. G. Piatt, of Utica School, N. Y.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Julia</span>,&mdash;<i>We have both known, in the past, a
certain delightsome country home; you&mdash;in earliest childhood,
and I&mdash;in latest youth-time: and I think we both relish those
reminders&mdash;perhaps a Kodak view, or an autumn gentian
plucked by the road-side, or actual glimpse of its woods, or
brook, on some summer’s drive&mdash;which have brought back the
old homestead, with its great stretch of undulating meadow&mdash;its
elms&mdash;its shady lanes&mdash;its singing birds&mdash;its leisurely going
big-eyed oxen&mdash;its long, tranquil days, when the large heart of
June was pulsing in all the leaves and all the air:</i></p>

<p><i>Well, even so, and by these light tracings of Lands and Kings,
and little whiffs of metric music, I seek to bring back to you,
and to your pupils and associates (who have so kindly received
previous and kindred reminders) the rich memories of that great
current of English letters setting steadily forward amongst
these British lands, and these sovereigns, from Elizabeth to
Anne. But slight as these glimpses are, and as this synopsis
may be, they will together serve, I hope, to fasten attention
where I wish to fasten it, and to quicken appetite for those
fuller and larger studies of English Literature and History,
which shall make even these sketchy outlines valued&mdash;as one
values little flowerets plucked from old fields&mdash;for bringing
again to mind the summers of youth-time, and a world of summer
days, with their birds and abounding bloom.</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>Affectionately yours,<br />
D. G. M.</i></p>

<h1><i>ENGLISH LANDS, LETTERS,
&amp; KINGS.</i></h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">We take outlook to-day from the threshold of
the seventeenth century. Elizabeth is dead
(1603), but not England. The powers it had grown
to under her quickening offices are all alive. The
great Spanish dragon has its teeth drawn; Cadiz
has been despoiled, and huge galleons, gold-laden,
have come trailing into Devon ports. France is
courteously friendly. Holland and England are in
leash, as against the fainter-growing blasts of Popedom.
In Ireland, Tyrone has been whipped into
bloody quietude. A syndicate of London merchants,
dealing in pepper and spices, has made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
beginnings of that East-Indian empire which gives
to the present British sovereign her proudest title.
London is growing apace in riches and in houses;
though her shipping counts for less than the Dutch
shipping, great cargoes come and go through the
Thames&mdash;spices from the East, velvets and glass
from the Mediterranean, cloths from the Baltic.
Cheapside is glittering with the great array of goldsmiths’
shops four stories high, and new painted
and new gilded (in 1594) by Sir Richard Martin,
Mayor. The dudes of that time walk and “publish”
their silken suits there, and thence through all
the lanes leading to Paul’s Walk&mdash;which is, effectively,
the aisle of the great church. There are noblemen
who have tall houses in the city and others
who have built along the Strand, with fine grounds
reaching to the river and looking out upon the
woods which skirt the bear-gardens of Bankside
in Southwark. The river is all alive with boats&mdash;wherries,
barges, skiffs. There are no hackney
carriages as yet for hire; but rich folks here and
there rumble along the highways in heavy Flemish
coaches.</p>

<p>Some of the great lights we have seen in the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
firmament of England have set. Burleigh
is gone; Hooker is gone, in the prime of his
years; Spenser gone, Marlowe gone, Sidney gone.
But enough are left at the opening of the century
and at the advent of James (1603) to keep the great
trail of Elizabethan literary splendors all aglow.
George Chapman (of the Homer) is alive and active;
and so are Raleigh, and Francis Bacon, and
Heywood, and Dekker, and Lodge. Shakespeare is
at his best, and is acting in his own plays at the
newly built Globe Theatre. Michael Drayton is in
full vigor, plotting and working at the tremendous
poem from which we culled&mdash;in advance&mdash;a pageful
of old English posies. Ben Jonson, too, is all
himself, whom we found a giant and a swaggerer,
yet a man of great learning and capable of the delicious
bits of poesy which I cited. You will further
remember how we set right the story of poor
Amy Robsart&mdash;told of the great Queen’s vanities&mdash;of
her visitings&mdash;of her days of illness&mdash;and of the
death of the last sovereign of the name of Tudor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Stuart Line.</h3>

<p>Henceforth, for much time to come, we shall
meet&mdash;when we encounter British royalty at all&mdash;with
men of the house of Stuart. But how comes
about this shifting of the thrones from the family
of Tudor to the family of Stuart? I explained in
a recent chapter how the name of Tudor became
connected with the crown, by the marriage of a
Welsh knight&mdash;Owen Tudor&mdash;with Katharine,
widow of Henry V. Now let us trace, if we can,
this name of Stuart. Henry VII. was a Tudor,
and so was Henry VIII.; so were his three children
who succeeded him&mdash;Edward, the bigot Mary, and
Elizabeth; no one of these, however, left direct
heirs; but Henry VIII. had a sister, Margaret, who
married James IV. of Scotland. This James was a
lineal descendant of a daughter of Robert Bruce,
who had married Walter Stuart, the chief of a
powerful Scotch family. That James I. of whom I
have spoken, who was a delicate poet, and so long a
prisoner in Windsor Tower, was great-grandson of
this Stuart-daughter of Robert Bruce. And from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
him&mdash;that is from James I.&mdash;was directly descended
James IV., who married the sister of
Henry VIII. James IV. had a son, succeeding
him, called James V. who by a French marriage,
became the father of that Frenchy queen, poor
Marie of Scotland, who suffered at Fotheringay,
and who had married her cousin, Henry Darnley
(he also having Stuart blood), by whom she had a
son, James Stuart&mdash;being James VI. of Scotland
and James I. of England, who now succeeds Elizabeth.</p>

<p>This strong Scotch strain in the Stuart line of
royalty will explain, in a certain degree, how ready
so clannish a people as the Scotch were to join insurrection
in favor of the exiled Stuarts; a readiness
you will surely remember if you have read
<cite>Waverley</cite> and <cite>Redgauntlet</cite>. And in further confirmation
of this clannish love, you will recall the
ever-renewed and gossipy boastfulness with which
the old Scotch gentlewoman, Lady Margaret Bellenden,
in <cite>Old Mortality</cite>, tells over and over of the
morning when his most gracious majesty Charles
II. partook of his <i lang="enm">disjune</i> at Tillietudlem Castle.</p>

<p>But we have nothing to do with so late affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
now, and I have only made this diversion into Scotland
to emphasize the facts about the Stuart affiliation
to the throne of England, and the reasons
for Scotch readiness to fling caps in the air for King
Charlie or for the Pretender.</p>

<h3>James I.</h3>

<p>And now what sort of person was this James
Stuart, successor to Elizabeth? He was a man in
his thirty-eighth year, who had been a king&mdash;or
called a king, of Scotland&mdash;ever since he was a
baby of twelve months old; and in many matters he
was a baby still. He loved bawbles as a child loves
its rattle; loved bright feathers too&mdash;to dress his
cap withal; was afraid of a drawn sword and of
hobgoblins. He walked, from some constitutional
infirmity, with the uncertain step of a child&mdash;swaying
about in a ram-shackle way&mdash;steadying himself
with a staff or a hold upon the shoulder of some
attendant. He slobbered when he ate, so that his
silken doublet&mdash;quilted to be proof against daggers&mdash;was
never of the cleanest. He had a big
head and protruding eyes, and would laugh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
talk broad Scotch with a blundering and halting
tongue, and crack unsavory jokes with his groom
or his barber.</p>

<p>Yet he had a certain kindness of heart; he hated
to see suffering, though he had no objection to suffering
he did not see; the sight of blood almost
made him faint; his affection for favorites sometimes
broke out into love-sick drivel. Withal he
had an acute mind; he had written bad poems,
before he left Scotland, calling himself modestly a
royal apprentice at that craft. He had a certain
knack at logical fence and loved to argue a man to
death; he had power of invective, as he showed in
his <cite>Counterblast to Tobacco</cite>&mdash;of which I will give
a whiff by and by. He had languages at command,
and loved to show it; for he had studied long and
hard in his young days, under that first and best
of Scotch scholars and pedagogues&mdash;George Buchanan.
He had, in general, a great respect for
sacred things, and for religious observances&mdash;which
did not prevent him, in his moments of petulant
wrath or of wine-y exaltation, from swearing
with a noisy vehemence. Lord Herbert of Cherbury&mdash;elder
brother of the poet Herbert, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
English ambassador to France&mdash;wittily excused
this habit of his sovereign, by saying he was too
kind to anathematize men himself, and therefore
asked God to do so.</p>

<p>This was the man who was to succeed the great
and courtly Elizabeth; this was the man toward
whom all the place-hunters of the court now directed
their thoughts, and (many of them) their
steps too, eager to be among the foremost to bow
in obsequience before him; besieging him, as every
United States President is besieged, and will be
besieged, until the disgraceful hunt for spoils is
checked by some nobler purpose on the part of political
victors than the rewarding of the partisans.</p>

<p>There was Sir Robert Cary&mdash;a far-away cousin
of Elizabeth’s&mdash;who was so bewitched to be foremost
in this agreeable business that he dashes
away at a headlong gallop, night and day&mdash;before
the royal couriers have started&mdash;gets thrown from
his horse, who gave him a vicious blow with his
heels, which he says “made me shed much blood.”
But he pushes on and carries first to Edinburgh the
tidings of the Queen’s death. Three days of the
sharpest riding would only carry the news in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
days; and the court messenger took a week or so
to get over the heavy roads between the Scotch
capital and London.</p>

<p>It does not appear that James made a show of
much sorrow; he must have remembered keenly,
through all his stolidity, how his mother, Mary
Queen of Scots, had suffered at Fotheringay; and
remembered through whose <i lang="la">fiat</i> this dismal tragedy
had come about. He hints that perhaps the
funeral services had better not tarry for his coming;&mdash;writes
that he would be glad of the crown
jewels (which they do not send, however) for the
new Queen’s wearing.</p>

<p>Then he sets off at leisure; travels at leisure;
receiving deputations at leisure, and all manner
of prostrations; stopping at Berwick; stopping at
Belvoir Castle; stopping at York; stopping wherever
was good eating or lodging or hunting; flatterers
coming in shoals to be knighted by him;
even the great Bacon, wanting to be Sir Francised&mdash;as
he was presently: and I am afraid the poets
of the time might have appeared, if they had possessed
the wherewithal to make the journey, and
were as hopeful of fat things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Curiously enough, the King is grandly entertained
in Huntingdonshire by one Oliver Cromwell,
to whom James takes a great liking; not, of
course, the great Cromwell; but this was the uncle
and the godfather of the famous Oliver, who was to
be chief instrument in bringing James’ royal son,
Charles, to the scaffold. Thence the King goes for
four or five days of princely entertainment to Theobalds,
a magnificent seat of old Burleigh’s, where
Elizabeth had gone often; and where his son, Cecil,
now plies the King with flatteries, and poisons
his mind perhaps against Raleigh&mdash;for whom Cecil
has no liking;&mdash;perhaps representing that Raleigh,
being in Parliament at the time, might have
stayed the execution of Queen Mary, if he had
chosen. The King is delighted with Theobalds; so
far delighted that a few years after he exchanges for
it his royal home of Hatfield House, which magnificent
place is still held by a descendant of Cecil, in
the person of the present Earl of Salisbury.</p>

<p>That place of Theobalds became afterward a pet
home of the King; he made great gardens there,
stocked with all manner of trees and fruits: every
great stranger in England must needs go to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the curious knots and mazes of flowers, and the
vineries and shrubbery; but the palace and gardens
are now gone. At last King Jamie gets to
London, quartering at the <em>Charter-house</em>&mdash;where is
now a school and a home of worn-out old pensioners
(dear old Colonel Newcome died there!) within
gunshot of the great markets by Smithfield;&mdash;and
James is as vain as a boy of sleeping and lording
it, at last, in a great capital of two realms that call
him master.</p>

<h3>Walter Raleigh.</h3>

<p>I said that his mind had been poisoned against
Raleigh;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that poison begins speedily to work.
There are only too many at the King’s elbow who
are jealous of the grave and courtly gentleman,
now just turned of fifty, and who has packed
into those years so much of high adventure; who
has written brave poems; who has fought gallantly
and on many fields; who has voyaged widely
in Southern and Western seas; who has made
discovery of the Guianas; who has, on a time, befriended
Spenser, and was mate-fellow with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
gallant Sidney; who was a favorite of the great
Queen; and whose fine speech, and lordly bearing,
and princely dress made him envied everywhere,
and hated by less successful courtiers. Possibly,
too, Raleigh had made unsafe speeches about the
chances of other succession to the throne. Surely
he who wore his heart upon his sleeve, and loved
brave deeds, could have no admiration for the
poltroon of a King who had gone a hunting when
the stains upon the scaffold on which his mother
suffered were hardly dry. So it happened that Sir
Walter Raleigh was accused of conspiring for the
dethronement of the new King, and was brought to
trial, with Cobham and others. The street people
jeered at him as he passed, for he was not popular;
he had borne himself so proudly with his exploits,
and gold, and his eagle eye. But he made so noble
a defence&mdash;so full&mdash;so clear&mdash;so eloquent&mdash;so impassioned,
that the same street people cheered him
as he passed out of court&mdash;but not to freedom.
The sentence was death: the King, however, feared
to put it to immediate execution. There was a
show, indeed, of a scaffold, and the order issued.
Cobham and Gray were haled out, and given last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
talks with an officiating priest, when the King ordered
stay of proceedings: he loved such mummery.
Raleigh went to the Tower, where for thirteen
years he lay a prisoner; and they show now
in the Tower of London the vaulted chamber that
was his reputed (but doubtful) home, where he
compiled, in conjunction with some outside friends&mdash;Ben
Jonson among the rest&mdash;that ponderous
<cite>History of the World</cite>, which is a great reservoir
of facts, stated with all grace and dignity, but
which, like a great many heavy, excellent books, is
never read. The matter-of-fact young man remembers
that Sir Walter Raleigh first brought potatoes
and (possibly) tobacco into England; but forgets
his ponderous <cite>History</cite>.</p>

<p>I may as well finish his story here and now,
though I must jump forward thirteen and more
years to accomplish it. At the end of that time the
King’s exchequer being low (as it nearly always
was), and there being rumors afloat of possible gold
findings in Raleigh’s rich country of Guiana, the old
knight, now in his sixty-seventh year, felt the spirit
of adventure stirred in him by the west wind that
crept through the gratings of his prison bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
tropical odors; and he volunteered to equip a fleet
in company with friends, and with the King’s permission
to go in quest of mines, to which he
believed, or professed to believe, he had the clew.
The permission was reluctantly granted; and poor
Lady Raleigh sold her estate, as well as their
beloved country home of Sherborne (in Dorset)
to vest in the new enterprise.</p>

<p>But the fates were against it: winds blew the
ships astray; tempests beat upon them; mutinies
threatened; and in Guiana, at last, there came disastrous
fights with the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Keymis, the second in command, and an old
friend of Raleigh’s, being reproached by this latter
in a moment of frenzy, withdraws and shoots himself;
Raleigh’s own son, too, is sacrificed, and the
crippled squadron sets out homeward, with no gold,
and shattered ships and maddened crews. Storm
overtakes them; there is mutiny; there is wreck;
only a few forlorn and battered hulks bring back
this disheartened knight. He lands in his old
home of Devon&mdash;is warned to flee the wrath that
will fall upon him in London; but as of old he lifts
his gray head proudly, and pushes for the capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to meet his accusers. Arrived there, he is made to
know by those strong at court that there is no
hope, for he has brought no gold; and yielding to
friendly entreaties he makes a final effort at escape.
He does outwit his immediate guards and takes to
a little wherry that bears him down the Thames: a
half-day more and he would have taken wings for
France. But the sleuth-hounds are on his track;
he is seized, imprisoned, and in virtue of his old
sentence&mdash;the cold-hearted Bacon making the law
for it&mdash;is brought to the block.</p>

<p>He walks to the scaffold with serene dignity&mdash;greets
old friends cheerfully&mdash;dies cheerfully, and
so enters on the pilgrimage he had set forth in his
cumbrous verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There the blessed paths we’ll travel,</div>
<div class="verse">Strow’d with rubies thick as gravel;</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again to his wife, in a last letter from his prison,
he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You shall receive, my dear wife, my last words in these
my last lines: my love I send you, that you may keep when
I am dead; and my counsel, that you may remember
when I am no more. I would not with my will, present you
sorrows, my dear Bess: let them go to the grave with me
and be buried in the dust. And seeing that it is not the will
of God that I shall meet you any more, bear my destruction
patiently, and with a heart like yourself.</p>

<p>“I beseech you for the love that you bear me living, that
you do not hide yourself many days; but, by your labors
seek to help my miserable fortunes, and the rights of your
poor child. Your mourning cannot avail me, that am but
dust. I sued for my life, but, God knows, it was for you and
yours that I desired it: for, know it, my dear wife, your
child is the child of a true man, who in his own respect, despiseth
Death and his misshapen and ugly forms. I cannot
write much (God knows how hardly I steal this time when
all sleep), and it is also time for me to separate my thoughts
from the world. Beg my dead body, which living was denied
you, and either lay it in Sherborne or Exeter church,
by my father and mother.</p>

<p>“My dear wife, farewell; bless my boy; pray for me;
and let my true God hold you both in his arms.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not as a literary man proper that I have
spoken of Raleigh; the poems that he wrote were
very few, nor were they overfine; but they did have
the glimmer in them of his great courage and of his
clear thought. They were never collected in book
shape in his own day, nor, indeed, till long after he
had gone: they were only occasional pieces,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> coming
to the light fitfully under stress of mind&mdash;a trail of
fire-sparks, as we may say, flying off from under
the trip-hammer of royal wrath or of desperate
fortunes.</p>

<p>Even his <cite>History</cite> was due to his captivity; his
enthusiasms, when he lived them in freedom, were
too sharp and quick for words. They spent themselves
in the blaze of battles&mdash;in breasting stormy
seas that washed shores where southern cypresses
grew, and golden promises opened with every sunrise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>And when I consider his busy and brilliant and
perturbed life, with its wonderful adventures, its
strange friendships, its toils, its quiet hours with
Spenser upon the Mulla shore, its other hours
amidst the jungles of the Orinoco, its lawless gallantries
in the court of Elizabeth, its booty snatched
from Spanish galleons he has set ablaze, its perils,
its long captivities&mdash;it is the life itself that seems
to me a great Elizabethan epic, with all its fires, its
mated couples of rhythmic sentiment, its poetic
splendors, its shortened beat and broken pauses and
blind turns, and its noble climacteric in a bloody
death that is without shame and full of the largest
pathos.</p>

<p>When you read Charles Kingsley’s story of <cite>Westward,
Ho!</cite> (which you surely should read, as well as
such other matter as the same author has written
relating to Raleigh) you will get a live glimpse of
this noble knight of letters, and of those other
brave and adventurous sailors of Devonshire, who
in those times took the keels of Plymouth over
great wastes of water. Kingsley writes of the
heroes of his native Devon, in the true Elizabethan
humor&mdash;putting fiery love and life into his writing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the roar of Atlantic gales breaks into his
pages, and they show, up and down, splashes of
storm-driven brine.</p>

<h3>Nigel and Harrison.</h3>

<p>In going back now to the earlier years of King
James’ reign, I shall make no apology for calling
attention to that engaging old story of the <cite>Fortunes
of Nigel</cite>. I know it is the fashion with many of the
astute critics of the day to pick flaws in Sir Walter,
and to expatiate on his blunders and shortcomings;
nevertheless, I do not think my readers can do better&mdash;in
aiming to acquaint themselves with this
epoch of English history&mdash;than to read over again
Scott’s representation of the personality and the
surroundings of the pedant King. There may be
errors in minor dates, errors of detail; but the
larger truths respecting the awkwardness and the pedantries
of the first Stuart King, and respecting the
Scotch adventurers who hung pressingly upon his
skirts, and the lawless street scenes which in those
days did really disturb the quietude of the great
metropolis, are pictured with a liveliness which will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
make them unforgetable. Macaulay says that out
of the gleanings left by historic harvesters Scott has
made “a history scarce less valuable than theirs.”
Nor do I think there is in the <cite>Fortunes of Nigel</cite> a deviation
from the truth (of which many must be admitted)
so extravagant and misleading as Mr. Freeman’s
averment, that in <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> “there is a mistake
in every line.” There are small truths and large
truths; and the competent artist knows which to
seize upon. Titian committed some fearful anachronisms,
and put Venetian stuffs upon Judean
women; Balthasar Denner, on the other hand,
painted with minute truthfulness every stubby hair
in a man’s beard, and no tailor could have excepted
to his button-holes: nobody knows Denner;
Titian reigns.</p>

<p>Among those whom Scott placed under tribute
for much of his local coloring was a gossipy, kindly
clergyman, William Harrison<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by name, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
born close by Bow Lane, in London, who studied
at Westminster, at Oxford, and Cambridge (as he
himself tells us), and who had a parish in Radwinter,
on the northern borders of Essex; who came
to be a canon, finally, at Windsor; and who died
ten years before James came to power. He tells
us, in a delightfully quaint way, of all the simples
which he grew in his little garden&mdash;of the manner
in which country houses were builded, and their
walls white-washed&mdash;of the open chimney vents,
and the smoke-burnished rafters. “And yet see
the change,” he says, “for when our houses were
builded of willow, then had we oken men; but now
that our houses are come to be made of oke, our
men are not onlie become willow, but a great
manie, through Persian delicacie crept in among
us, altogether of straw, which is a sore alteration.”</p>

<p>When the old parson gets upon the subject of
dress he waxes eloquent; nor was he without fullest
opportunities for observation, having been for
much time private chaplain to the Earl of Cobham.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Oh, how much cost,” he says, “is bestowed now-a-daies
upon our bodies, and how little upon our soules! How many
sutes of apparel hath the one, and how little furniture hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the other! How curious, how nice are the men and women,
and how hardlie can the tailer please them in making things
fit for their bodies. How many times must they be sent
back againe to him that made it. I will say nothing of our
heads, which sometimes are polled, sometimes curled, or suffered
to grow at length like woman’s locks, manie times cut
off above or under the ears, round, as by a wooden dish.
Neither will I meddle with our varieties of beards, of which
some are shaven from the chin like those of the Turks, not
a few cut like to the beard of Marquess Otto; some made
round, like a rubbing brush, others with a <i lang="fr">pique devant</i> (O
fine fashion!).</p>

<p>“In women, too, it is much to be lamented that they doo
now far exceed the lightness of our men, and such staring
attire as in times past was supposed meet for none but
light housewives onelie, is now become an habit for chaste
and sober matrons. What should I say of their doublets with
pendant pieces on the brest, full of jags and cuts, and sleeves
of sundrie colors, I have met with some of these <em>trulles</em> in
London, so disguised, that it hath passed my skill to discerne
whether they were men or women.”</p>

</div>

<p>If this discerning old gentleman had shot his
quill along our sidewalks, I think it would have
punctured a good deal of bloat, and stirred up no
little bustle. The King himself had a great liking
for fine dress in others, though he was himself a
sloven. Lord Howard, a courtier, writes to a
friend who is hopeful of preferment:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I would wish you to be well trimmed; get a new Jerkin
well bordered, and not too short: the King liketh it flowing.
Your ruff should be well stiffened and bushy. The King is
nicely heedful of such points. Eighteen servants were lately
discharged, and many more will be discarded who are not to
his liking in these matters.” And again, speaking of a favorite,
he says:&mdash;“Carr hath changed his tailors, and tiremen
many times, and all to please the Prince, who laugheth
at the long-grown fashion of our young courtiers, and wisheth
for change everie day.”</p>

</div>

<h3>A London Bride.</h3>

<p>One other little bit of high light upon the every-day
ways of London living, in the early years of
King James, we are tempted to give. It comes out
in the private letter of a new-married lady, who was
daughter and heiress of that enormously rich merchant,
Sir John Spencer, who was Lord Mayor of
London; and who, in Elizabeth’s time (as well as
James’), lived in Crosby Hall, still standing in the
thick of London city, near to where Thread and
Needle Street, at its eastern end, abuts upon Bishopsgate.
Every voyaging American should go to
see this best type of domestic architecture of the
fifteenth century now existing in London; and it
will quicken his interest in the picturesque old pile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to know that Richard III., while Duke of Gloucester,
passed some critical days and nights there, and
that for some years it was the home of Sir Thomas
More. The Spencer heiress, however&mdash;of whom
we began to make mention&mdash;brightened its interior
at a later day; there were many suitors for
her hand; among them a son of Lord Compton&mdash;not
looked upon with favor by the rich merchant&mdash;and
concealing his advances under the disguise of
a baker’s boy, through which he came to many
stolen interviews, and at last (as tradition tells)
was successful enough to trundle away the heiress,
covertly, in his baker’s barrow. Through the good
offices of Queen Elizabeth, who stood god-mother
to the first child, difficulties between father and
son-in-law were healed; and when, later, by the
death of Sir John Spencer, the bridegroom was
assured of the enormous wealth inherited by his
bride, he was&mdash;poor man&mdash;nearly crazed.</p>

<p>Among the curative processes for his relief may
be reckoned the letter from his wife to which I have
made allusion, and which runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My sweet Life, I pray and beseech you to grant me the
sum of £2,600 [equivalent to some $30,000 now] quarterly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
also, besides, £600 quarterly for charities, of which I will
give no account. Also, I would have 3 horses for my own
saddle, that none shall dare to lend or borrow. Also; 2 gentlewomen
(lest one should be sick)&mdash;seeing it is an indecent
thing for a gentlewoman to stand mumping alone,
when God hath blessed the Lord and Lady with a great
Estate: Also, when I ride, a hunting or a hawking, I would
have them attend: so, for either of those said women there
must be a horse.</p>

<p>“Also, I would have 6 or 8 gentlemen; I will have my
two coaches&mdash;one lined with velvet to myself, with four
very fair horses, and a coach for my women lined with
cloth, and laced with gold;&mdash;otherwise with scarlet and
laced with silver, with four good horses. Thereafter, my
desire is that you defray all charges for me, and beside my
allowance, I would have 20 gowns of apparel a year&mdash;six of
them excellent good ones. Also, I would have to put in my
purse £2,000 or so&mdash;you to pay my debts. And seeing I
have been so reasonable, I pray you do find my children apparel,
and their schooling, and all my servants, men and
women, with wages. Also, I must have £6,000 to buy me
jewels, and £4,000 to buy me a gold chain. Also, my desire
is, that you would pay your debts&mdash;build up Ashley House,
and lend no money as you love God! When you be an Earl
[as he was afterward in Charles I.’s time] I pray you to allow
£2,000 more than I now desire and double attendance.”</p>

</div>

<p>Happy husband!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h3>Ben Jonson again.</h3>

<p>We must not forget our literature; and what
has become of our friend Ben Jonson in these
times? He is hearty and thriving; he has written
gratulatory and fulsome verses to the new sovereign.
He is better placed with James than even
with Elizabeth. If his tragedy of “Sejanus” has
not found a great success, he has more than made
up the failing by the brilliant masques he has written.
The pedantic King loves their pretty show of
classicism, which he can interpret better than his
courtiers. He battens, too, upon the flattery that
is strown with a lavish hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Never came man more longed for, more desired,</div>
<div class="verse">And being come, more reverenced, lov’d, admired.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is the strain; no wonder that the poet comes
by pension; no wonder he has “commands,” with
goodly fees, to all the fêtes in the royal honor. Yet
he is too strong and robust and learned to be called
a mere sycophant. The more I read of the literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
history of those days the more impressed I am
by the predominance of Ben Jonson;&mdash;a great,
careless, hard-living, hard-drinking, not ill-natured
literary monarch. His strength is evidenced by the
deference shown him&mdash;by his versatility; now some
musical masque sparkling with little dainty bits
which a sentimental miss might copy in her album
or chant in her boudoir; and this, matched or
followed by some labored drama full of classic
knowledge, full of largest wordcraft, snapping with
fire-crackers of wit, loaded with ponderous nuggets
of strong sense, and the whole capped and booted
with prologue and epilogue where poetic graces
shine through proudest averments of indifference&mdash;of
scorn of applause&mdash;of audacious self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>It was some fifteen years after James’ coming
to power that Ben Jonson made his memorable
Scotch journey&mdash;perhaps out of respect for his
forebears, who had gone, two generations before,
out of Annandale&mdash;perhaps out of some lighter
caprice. In any event it would have been only a
commonplace foot-journey of a middle-aged man,
well known over all Britain as poet and dramatist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with no special record of its own, except for a visit
of a fortnight which he made, in the north country,
to Drummond of Hawthornden:&mdash;this made it
memorable. For this Drummond was a note-taker;
he was a smooth but not strong poet; was
something proud of his Scotch lairdship; lived in a
beautiful home seated upon a crag that lifts above
the beautiful valley of Eskdale; its picturesque irregularities
of tower and turret are still very charming,
and Eskdale is charming with its wooded walks,
cliffs, pools, and bridges; Roslin Castle is near by,
and Roslin Chapel, and so is Dalkeith.</p>

<p>The tourist of our time can pass no pleasanter
summer’s day than in loiterings there and thereabout.
Echoes of Scott’s border minstrelsy beat
from bank to bank. Poet Drummond was proud to
have poet Jonson as a guest, and hospitably plied
him with “strong waters;” under the effusion Jonson
dilated, and Drummond, eagerly attentive,
made notes. These jottings down, which were not
voluminous, and which were not published until
after both parties were in their graves, have been
subject of much and bitter discussion, and relate to
topics lying widely apart. There is talk of Petrarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and of Queen Elizabeth&mdash;of Marston and of Overbury&mdash;of
Drayton and Donne&mdash;of Shakespeare
(all too little)&mdash;of King James and Petronius&mdash;of
Jonson’s “shrew of a wife” and of Sir Francis
Bacon; and there are more or less authentic stories
of Spenser and Raleigh and Sidney. Throughout
we find the burly British poet very aggressive, very
outspoken, very penetrative and fearless: and we
find his Scotch interviewer a little overawed by the
other’s audacities, and not a little resentful of his
advice to him&mdash;to study Quintillian.</p>

<h3>An Italian Reporter.</h3>

<p>It was in the very year of Ben Jonson’s return
from the north that a masque of his&mdash;“Pleasure is
Reconciled to Virtue”&mdash;was represented at Whitehall;
and it so happens that we have a lively glimpse
of this representation from the note-book of an
Italian gentleman who was chaplain to Pietro Contarini,
then ambassador from Venice, and who was
living at Sir Pindar’s home in Bishopsgate Street
(a locality still kept in mind by a little tavern now
standing thereabout called “Sir Pindar’s Head”).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>This report of Busino, the Italian gentleman of
whom I spoke, about his life in London, was buried
in the archives of Venice, until unearthed about
twenty years since by an exploring Englishman.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
So it happens, that in this old Venetian document
we seem to look directly through those foreign eyes,
closed for two hundred and seventy years, upon the
play at Whitehall.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For two hours,” he says, “we were forced to wait in the
Venetian box, very hot and very crowded. Then the Lord
Chamberlain came up, and wanted to add another, who was
a greasy Spaniard.”</p>

</div>

<p>This puts Busino in an ill humor (there was no
good-will between Italy and Spain in those days);
but he admires the women&mdash;“all so many queens.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There were some very lovely faces, and at every moment
my companions kept exclaiming: ‘Oh, do look at this
one!’ ‘Oh, do see that other!’ ‘Whose wife is this?’ ‘And
that pretty one near her, whose daughter is she?’ [Curious
people!] Then the King came in and took the ambassador
to his royal box, directly opposite the stage, and the play
began at 10 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>There was Bacchus on a car, followed by Silenus
on a barrel, and twelve wicker-flasks representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
very lively beer bottles, who performed numerous
antics; then a moving Mount Atlas, as big as the
stage would permit; scores of classic affectations
and astonishing mythologic mechanism; and at
last, with a great bevy of pages, twelve cavaliers in
masques&mdash;the Prince Charles (afterward Charles I.)
being chief of the revellers.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These all choose partners and dance every kind of
dance&mdash;every cavalier selecting his lady. After an hour or
two of this, they, being tired, began to flag;” whereat&mdash;says
the chaplain&mdash;“the choleric King James got impatient
and shouted out from his box, ‘Why don’t they dance?
What did you make me come here for? Devil take you all&mdash;dance!’”</p>

</div>

<p>What a light this little touch of the old gentleman’s
choleric spirit throws upon the court manners
of that time!</p>

<p>Then Buckingham, the favorite, whom Scott introduces
in <cite>Nigel</cite> as Steenie&mdash;comes forward to
placate the King, and cuts a score of lofty capers
with so much grace and agility as not only to quiet
the wrathy monarch but to delight everybody.
Afterward comes the banquet, at which his most sacred
majesty gets tipsy, and amid a general smashing
of Venetian glass, continues the Italian gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
“I went home, very tired, at two o’clock in
the morning.”</p>

<p>Ah, if we could only unearth some good old
play-going chaplain’s account of how Shakespeare
appeared&mdash;of his dress&mdash;of his voice&mdash;and with
what unction of manner he set before the little
audience at the Globe, or Blackfriars, his part of
Old Adam (which there is reason to believe he
took), in his own delightful play of “As You Like
It.” What would we not give to know the very
attitude, and the wonderful pity in his look, with
which he spoke to his young master, Orlando:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh, my sweet master, what make you here?</div>
<div class="verse">Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, what a world is this, when what is comely</div>
<div class="verse">Envenoms him, that bears it!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Shakespeare and the Globe.</h3>

<p>Neither our Italian friend, however, nor Ben
Jonson have given us any such glimpse as we
would like to have of that keen-witted Warwickshire
actor and playwright who, in the early years
of James’ reign, is living off and on in London;
having bought, within a few years&mdash;as the records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
tell us&mdash;a fine New Place in Stratford, and has
won great favor with that King Jamie, who with all
his pedantry knows a good thing when he sees it,
or hears it. Indeed, there is some warrant for believing
that the King wrote a commendatory letter
to the great dramatist, of which Mr. Black, in our
time, makes shadowy use in that Shakespearean romance
of his,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> you may have encountered. The
novelist gives us some very charming pictures of
the Warwickshire landscape, and he has made Miss
Judith Shakespeare very arch and engaging; but it
was perilous ground for any novelist to venture
upon; and I think the author felt it, and has shown
a timidity and doubt that have hampered him; I
do not recognize in it the breezy freedom that belonged
to his treatment of things among the Hebrides.
But to return to “Judith’s father”&mdash;he is
part proprietor of the Globe Theatre, taking in lots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of money (old cronies say) in that way; was honored
by the Queen, too, before her death, and had
written that “Merry Wives of Windsor,” tradition
says, to show Queen Bess how the Fat Falstaff
would carry his great hulk as a lover.</p>

<p>We might meet this Shakespeare at that Mermaid
Tavern we spoke of; but should look out for him
more hopefully about one of the playhouses. Going
from the Mermaid, supposing we were putting
up there in those days, we should strike across
St. Paul’s Churchyard, and possibly taking Paul’s
Walk, and so down Ludgate Hill; and thence on,
bearing southerly to Blackfriars; which locality has
now its commemoration in the name of Playhouse
Yard, and is in a dingy quarter, with dingy great
warehouses round it. Arrived there we should
learn, perhaps by a poster on the door, that the
theatre would not open till some later hour. Blackfriars<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
was a private theatre, roofed over entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and lighted with candles; also, through Elizabeth’s
time, opening generally on Sundays&mdash;that being
a popular day&mdash;hours being chosen outside of
prayer or church-time; and this public dramatic
observance of Sunday was only forbidden by express
enactment after James came to the throne.
At her palace, and with her child-players, Sunday
was always Queen Elizabeth’s favorite day.</p>

<p>This Blackfriars was at only a little remove
down the Thames from that famous Whitefriars
region of which there is such melodramatic account
in Scott’s story of <cite>Nigel</cite>, where Old Trapbois
comes to his wild death. If we went to the Globe
Theatre, we should push on down to the river&mdash;near
to a point where Blackfriars Bridge now spans
it&mdash;then, a clear stream free from all bridges, save
only London Bridge, which would have loomed,
with its piles of houses, out of the water on our
left. At the water-side we should take wherry (fare
only one penny) and be sculled over to Southwark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
landing at an open place&mdash;Bankside&mdash;near which
was Paris Garden, where bear-baiting was still carried
on with high kingly approval; and thereabout,
on a spot now swallowed in a gulf of smoked and
blackened houses&mdash;just about the locality where at
a later day stood Richard Baxter’s Chapel, rose the
octagonal walls of the Globe Theatre, in which
Mr. Shakespeare was concerned as player and part
proprietor. There should be a flag flying aloft and
people lounging in, paying their two-pence, their
sixpences, their shillings, or even their half-crowns&mdash;as
they chose the commoner or the better
places. Only the stage is roofed over; perhaps
also a narrow space all round the walls; from all
otherwheres within, one could look up straight into
the murky sky of London. There is apple-eating,
nut-cracking, and some vender of pamphlets bawling
“Buy a new booke;” such a one perhaps as
that <cite>Horne Booke of Gulls</cite>&mdash;which I told you of,
written by Dekker&mdash;would have been a favorite for
such venders. Or, possibly through urgence of the
Court Chamberlain, King James’ <cite>Counterblaste to
Tobacco</cite> may be put on sale there, to mend manners;
or Joshua Sylvester’s little poem to the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
end, entitled <cite>Tobacco battered and the Pipes shattered
about their Eares that idly idolize so base and barbarous
a Weed, by a Volley of hot shot, thundered from
Mount Helicon</cite>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“How juster will the Heavenly God,</div>
<div class="verse">Th’ Eternal, punish with infernal rod</div>
<div class="verse">In Hell’s dark furnace, with black fumes to choak</div>
<div class="verse">Those that on Earth will still offend in Smoak.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But hot as this sort of shot might have been, we
may be sure that some fast fellows, the critics and
<i lang="el">æsthetes</i> of those days, will have their place on the
stage, sprawling there upon the edge, before the
actors appear; criticising players and audience and
smoking their long pipes; may be taking a hand
at cards, and if very “swell,” tossing the cards over
to people in the pit when once their game is over&mdash;a
showy and arrogant largess.</p>

<p>Perhaps Ben Jonson will come swaggering in,
having taken a glass, or two, very likely, or even
three, in the tap-room of the Tabard Tavern&mdash;the
famous Tabard of Chaucer’s tales&mdash;which is
within practicable drinking distance; and Will
Shakespeare, if indeed there, may greet him across
two benches with, “Ah, Ben,” and he&mdash;tipsily in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
reply, with “Ah, my good fellow, Will.” Those
prim young men, Beaumont and Fletcher, who are
just now pluming their wings for such dramatic
flights as these two older men have made, may
also be there. And the play will open with three
little bursts of warning music; always a prologue
with a first representation; and it may chance
that the very one we have lighted upon, is some
special exhibit of that great military spectacle
of “Henry V.” which we know, and all the
times between have known; and it may be that
this Shakespeare, being himself author and in a
sense manager of these boards, may come forward
to speak the prologue himself; how closely we
would have eyed him, and listened:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“Pardon, gentles all;</div>
<div class="verse">The flat, unraiséd spirit, that hath dared</div>
<div class="verse">On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</div>
<div class="verse">So great an object: Can this cockpit hold</div>
<div class="verse">The vasty fields of France? or may we cram</div>
<div class="verse">Within this wooden O, the very casques</div>
<div class="verse">That did affright the air at Agincourt?</div>

<div class="verse">Turning the accomplishment of many years</div>
<div class="verse">Into an hour-glass.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And then the play begins and we see them all:
Gloucester and the brave king, and Bedford, and
Fluellen, and the pretty Kate of France (by some
boy-player), and Nym, and Pistol, and Dame
Quickly; and the drums beat, and the roar of battle
breaks and rolls away&mdash;as only Shakespeare’s
words can make battles rage; and the French Kate
is made Queen, and so the end comes.</p>

<p>All this might have happened; I have tried to
offend against no historic data of places, or men, or
dates in this summing up. And from the doors of
the Globe, where we are assailed by a clamor of
watermen and linkboys, we go down to the river’s
edge&mdash;scarce a stone’s-throw distant&mdash;and take
our wherry, on the bow of which a light is now
flaming, and float away in the murky twilight upon
that great historic river&mdash;watching the red torch-fires,
kindling one by one along the Strand shores,
and catching the dim outline of London houses&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
London of King James I.&mdash;looming through
the mists behind them.</p>

<p>In our next chapter I shall have somewhat more
to say of the Stratford man&mdash;specially of his personality;
and more to say of King James, and of his
English Bible.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">We have had our glimpse of the first (English)
Stuart King, as he made his shambling
way to the throne&mdash;beset by spoilsmen; we
had our glimpse, too, of that haughty, high-souled,
unfortunate Sir Walter Raleigh, whose memory all
Americans should hold in honor. We had our little
look through the magic-lantern of Scott at the toilet
and the draggled feathers of the pedant King
James, and upon all that hurly-burly of London
where the Scotch Nigel adventured; and through
the gossipy Harrison we set before ourselves a
great many quaint figures of the time. We saw a
bride whose silken dresses whisked along those balusters
of Crosby Hall, which brides of our day may
touch reverently now; we followed Ben Jonson,
afoot, into Scotland, and among the pretty scenes
of Eskdale; and thereafter we sauntered down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Ludgate Hill, and so, by wherry, to Bankside and
the Globe, where we paid our shilling, and passed
the time o’ day with Ben Jonson; and saw young
Francis Beaumont, and smelt the pipes; and had a
glimpse of Shakespeare. But we must not, for this
reason, think that all the world of London smoked,
or all the world of London went to the Globe Theatre.</p>

<h3>Gosson and Other Puritans.</h3>

<p>There was at this very time, living and preaching,
in the great city, a certain Stephen Gosson<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;well-known,
doubtless, to Ben Jonson and his fellows&mdash;who
had received a university education,
who had written delicate pastorals and other verse,
which&mdash;with many people&mdash;ranked him with
Spenser and Sidney; who had written plays too, but
who, somehow conscience-smitten, and having gone
over from all dalliance with the muses to extremest
Puritanism, did thereafter so inveigh against
“<cite>Poets, Players, Jesters, and such like Caterpillars of
the Commonwealth</cite>”&mdash;as he called them&mdash;as made
him rank, for fierce invective, with that Stubbes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
whose onslaught upon the wickedness of the day I
cited. He had called his discourse, “<cite>pleasant for
Gentlemen that favor Learning, and profitable for all
that will follow Vertue</cite>.” He represented the Puritan
feeling&mdash;which was growing in force&mdash;in respect
to poetry and the drama; and, I have no
doubt, regarded Mr. William Shakespeare as one of
the best loved and trusted emissaries of Satan.</p>

<p>But between the rigid sectarians and those of
easy-going faith who were wont to meet at the Mermaid
Tavern, there was a third range of thinking
and of thinkers;&mdash;not believing all poetry and poets
Satanic, and yet not neglectful of the offices of
Christianity. The King himself would have ranked
with these; and so also would the dignitaries of
that English Church of which he counted himself,
in some sense, the head. It was in the first year of
his reign, 1603&mdash;he having passed a good part of
the summer in hunting up and down through the
near counties&mdash;partly from his old love of such
things, partly to be out of reach of the plague
which ravaged London that year (carrying off over
thirty thousand people); it was, I say, in that first
year that, at the instance of some good Anglicans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
he issued a proclamation&mdash;“<cite>Touching a meeting for
the hearing and for the determining things pretended
to be amiss in the Church.</cite>”</p>

<p>Out of this grew a conference at Hampton Court,
in January, 1604. Twenty-five were called to that
gathering, of whom nine were Bishops. On no one
day were they all present; nor did there seem
promise of any great outcome from this assemblage,
till one Rainolds, a famous Greek scholar of
Oxford, “moved his Majesty that there might be a
new translation of the Bible, because previous ones
were not answerable altogether to the truth of the
Original.”</p>

<h3>King James’ Bible.</h3>

<p>There was discussion of this; my Lord Bancroft,
Bishop of London, venturing the sage remark that
if every man’s humor should be followed, there
would be no end of translating. In the course of
the talk we may well believe that King James nodded
approval of anything that would flatter his
kingly vanities, and shook his big unkempt head at
what would make call for a loosening of his purse-strings.
But out of this slumberous conference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and out of these initial steps, did come the scriptural
revision; and did come that noble monument
of the English language, and of the Christian faith,
sometimes called “King James’ Bible,” though&mdash;for
anything that the old gentleman had to do vitally
or specifically with the revision&mdash;it might as
well have been called the Bible of King James’ tailor,
or the Bible of King James’ cat.</p>

<p>It must be said, however, for the King, that he
did press for a prompt completion of the work, and
that “it should be done by the best learned in both
universities.” Indeed, if the final dedication of the
translators to the “most High, and Mighty Prince
James” (which many a New England boy of fifty
years ago wrestled with in the weary lapses of too
long a sermon) were to be taken in its literal
significance, the obligations to him were immense;
after thanking him as “principal mover and author
of the work,” the dedication exuberantly declares
that “the hearts of all your loyal and religious people
are so bound and firmly knit unto you, that
your very name is precious among them: Their
eye doth behold you with comfort, and they bless
you in their hearts, as that sanctified person, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
under God, is the immediate author of their true
Happiness.” The King’s great reverence for the
Scriptures is abundantly evidenced by that little
tractate of his&mdash;the <cite>Basilikon Doron</cite>&mdash;not written
for publication (though surreptitiously laid hold of
by the book-makers) but intended for the private
guidance of his eldest son, Prince Henry, in that
time heir to the throne. The little book shows
large theologic discretions; and&mdash;saving some
scornings of the “vaine, Pharisaicall Puritaines”&mdash;is
written in a spirit which might be safely commended
to later British Princes.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When yee reade the Scripture [says the King] reade it
with a sanctified and chast hart; admire reverentlie such
obscure places as ye understand not, blaming only your own
capacitie; reade with delight the plaine places, and study
carefully to understand those that are somewhat difficile:
preasse to be a good textuare; for the Scripture is ever the
best interpreter of itselfe.”</p>

</div>

<p>Some forty odd competent men were set out
from the universities and elsewheres for the work
of the Bible revision. Yet they saw none of King
James’ money, none from the royal exchequer;
which indeed from the King’s disorderly extravagances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
that helped nobody, was always lamentably
low. The revisers got their rations, when they
came together in conference, in Commons Hall, or
where and when they could; and only at the last
did some few of them who were engaged in the
final work of proof-reading, get a stipend of some
thirty shillings a week from that fraternity of book-makers
who were concerned with the printing and
selling of the new Bible.</p>

<p>When the business of revision actually commenced
it is hard to determine accurately; but it
was not till the year 1611&mdash;eight years after the
Hampton Conference&mdash;that an edition was published
by printer Barker (who, or whose company,
was very zealous about the matter, it being a fat
job for him) and so presently, under name of King
James’ version “appointed (by assemblage of Bishops)
to be read in churches,” it came to be the
great Bible of the English-speaking world&mdash;then,
and thence-forward. And now, who were the forty
men who dealt so wisely and sparingly with the
old translators; who came to their offices of revision
with so tender a reverence, and who put such
nervous, masculine, clear-cut English into their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
own emendations of this book as to leave it a monument
of Literature? Their names are all of record:
and yet if I were to print them, the average
reader would not recognize, I think, a single one
out of the twoscore.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> You would not find Bacon’s
name, who, not far from this time was writing some
of his noblest essays, and also writing (on the
King’s suggestion) about preaching and Church
management. You would not find the name of
William Camden, who was then at the mellow age
of sixty, and of a rare reputation for learning and
for dignity of character. You would not find the
name of Lord Herbert of Cherbury, who though
writing much of religious intention, was deistically
inclined; nor of Robert Burton, churchman, and
author of that famous book <cite>The Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>&mdash;then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in his early prime; nor of Sir Walter
Raleigh, nor of Sir Thomas Overbury&mdash;both now
at the date of their best powers; nor yet would one
find mention of John Donne,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> though he came to
be Dean of St. Paul’s and wrote poems the reader
may&mdash;and ought to know; nor, yet again, is there
any hearing of Sir John Davies, who had commended
himself specially to King James, and who
had written poetically and reverently on the <cite>Immortality
of the Soul</cite><a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in strains that warrant our citing
a few quatrains:&mdash;</p>

<p>This is a long aside; but it gives us good breath
to go back to our translators, who if not known to
the general reader, were educators or churchmen of
rank; men of trained minds who put system and
conscience and scholarship into their work. And
their success in it, from a literary aspect only, shows
how interfused in all cultivated minds of that day
was a keen apprehension and warm appreciation of
the prodigious range, and the structural niceties,
and rhythmic forces of that now well-compacted
English language which Chaucer and Spenser and
Shakespeare, each in his turn, had published to the
world, with brilliant illustration.</p>

<p>And will this old Bible of King James’ version
continue to be held in highest reverence? Speaking
from a literary point of view&mdash;which is our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
stand-point to-day&mdash;there can be no doubt that it
will; nor is there good reason to believe that&mdash;on
literary lines&mdash;any other will ever supplant it.
There may be versions that will be truer to the
Greek; there may be versions that will be far
truer to the Hebrew; there may be versions that
will mend its science&mdash;that will mend its archæology&mdash;that
will mend its history; but never one,
I think, which, as a whole, will greatly mend that
orderly and musical and forceful flow of language
springing from early English sources, chastened by
Elizabethan culture and flowing out&mdash;freighted
with Christian doctrine&mdash;over all lands where
Saxon speech is uttered. Nor in saying this, do
I yield a jot to any one&mdash;in respect for that
modern scholarship which has shown bad renderings
from the Greek, and possibly far worse ones
from the Hebrew. No one&mdash;it is reasonably to be
presumed&mdash;can safely interpret doctrines of the
Bible without the aid of this scholarship and of
the “higher criticism;” and no one will be henceforth
fully trusted in such interpretation who is
ignorant of, or who scorns the recent revisions.</p>

<p>And yet the old book, by reason of its strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sweet, literary quality, will keep its hold in most
hearts and most minds. Prove to the utmost that
the Doxology,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> at the end of the Lord’s Prayer, is
an interpolation&mdash;that it is nowhere in the earlier
Greek texts (and I believe it is abundantly proven),
and yet hundreds, and thousands, and tens of thousands
who use that invocation, will keep on saying,
in the rhythmic gush of praise, which is due maybe
to some old worthy of the times of the Henrys (perhaps
Tyndale himself)&mdash;“For thine is the Kingdom,
and the Power, and the Glory, for ever and
ever, Amen!”</p>

<p>And so with respect to that splendid Hebraic
poem of Job, or that mooted book of Ecclesiastes;
no matter what critical scholarship may do in amplification
or curtailment, it can never safely or
surely refine away the marvellous graces of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
strong, old English current&mdash;burdened with tender
memories&mdash;murmurous with hopes drifting
toward days to come&mdash;“or ever the silver cord be
loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher
be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at
the cistern.”</p>

<p>The scientists may demonstrate that this ancient
oak&mdash;whose cooling shadows have for so many
ages given comfort and delight&mdash;is overgrown, unshapely,
with needless nodules, and corky rind,
and splotches of moss, and seams that show stress
of gone-by belaboring tempests; they may make
it clear that these things are needless for its support&mdash;that
they cover and cloak its normal organic
structure; but who shall hew them clean away, and
yet leave in fulness of stature and of sheltering
power the majestic growth we venerate? I know
the reader may say that this is a sentimental view;
so it is; but science cannot measure the highest
beauty of a poem; and with whose, or what fine
scales shall we weigh the sanctities of religious
awe?</p>

<p>It must be understood, however, that the charms
of the “King James’ Version” do not lie altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in Elizabethan beauties of phrase, or in Jacobean
felicities; there are quaint archaisms in it which
we are sure have brought their pleasant reverberations
of lingual sound all the way down from the
days of Coverdale, of Tyndale, and of Wyclif.</p>

<p>A few facts about the printing and publishing
of the early English Bibles it may be well to
call to mind. In a previous chapter I spoke of the
fatherly edicts against Bible-reading and Bible-owning
in the time of Henry VIII.; but the reign
of his son, Edward VI., was a golden epoch for the
Bible printers. During the six years when this
boy-king held the throne, fifty editions&mdash;principally
Coverdale’s and Tyndale’s versions&mdash;were
issued, and no less than fifty-seven printers were
engaged in their manufacture.</p>

<p>Queen Mary made difficulties again, of which a
familiar and brilliant illustration may be found in
that old New England Primer which sets forth in
ghastly wood-cut “the burning of Mr. John Rogers
at the Stake, in Smithfield.” Elizabeth was
coy; she set a great many prison-doors open; and
when a courtier said, “May it please your Majesty,
there be sundry other prisoners held in durance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and it would much comfort God’s people that they
be set free.” She asked, “Whom?” And the good
Protestant said, “Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.”
But she&mdash;young as she was&mdash;showed her monarch
habit. “Let us first find,” said she, “if they wish
enlargement.”</p>

<p>But she had accepted the gift of a Bible on first
passing through Cheapside&mdash;had pressed it to her
bosom in sight of the street people, and said she
should “oft read that holy book”&mdash;which was easy
to say, and becoming.</p>

<p>In the early days of her reign the Genevan Bible,
always a popular one in England, was completed,
and printed mostly in Geneva; but a privilege for
printing it in England was assigned to John Bodley&mdash;that
John Bodley whose more eminent son,
Sir Thomas, afterward founded and endowed the
well-known Bodleian Library at Oxford.</p>

<p>In the early part of Elizabeth’s reign appeared,
too, the so-called Bishops’ Bible (now a rare book),
under charge of Archbishop Parker, fifteen dignitaries
of the Church being joined with him in its
supervision. There were engravings on copper
and wood&mdash;of Elizabeth, on the title-page&mdash;of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
gay Earl of Leicester at the head of the Book of
Joshua, and of old, nodding Lord Burleigh in the
Book of Psalms. But the Bishops’ Bible was never
so popular as the Geneva one. During the reign
of Elizabeth there were no less than one hundred
and thirty distinct issues of Bibles and Testaments,
an average of three a year.</p>

<p>It may interest our special parish to know further
that the first American (English) Bible was printed
at Philadelphia, by a Scotchman named Aitkin, in
the year 1782; but the first Bible printed in America
was in the German language, issued by Christopher
Sauer, at Germantown, in 1743.</p>

<p>But I will not encroach any further upon biblical
teachings: we will come back to our secular poets,
and to that bravest and finest figure of them all,
who was born upon the Avon.</p>

<h3>Shakespeare.</h3>

<p>I have tried&mdash;I will confess it now&mdash;to pique
the reader’s curiosity, by giving him stolen glimpses
from time to time of the great dramatist, and by
putting off, in chapter after chapter, any full or
detailed mention of him, or of his work. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
when I first entered upon these talks respecting
English worthies&mdash;whether places, or writers, or
sovereigns&mdash;I said to myself&mdash;when we come up
with that famous Shakespeare, whom all the world
knows so well, and about whom so much has been
said and written&mdash;we will make our obeisance, lift
our hat, and pass on to the lesser men beyond. So
large a space did the great dramatist fill in the delightsome
journey we were to make together, down
through the pleasant country of English letters,
that he seemed not so much a personality as some
great British stronghold, with outworks, and with
pennons flying&mdash;standing all athwart the Elizabethan
Valley, down which our track was to lead us.
From far away back of Chaucer, when the first Romances
of King Arthur were told, when glimpses of
a King Lear and a Macbeth appeared in old chronicles&mdash;this
great monument of Elizabethan times
loomed high in our front; and go far as we may
down the current of English letters, it will not be
out of sight, but loom up grandly behind us. And
now that we are fairly abreast of it, my fancy still
clings to that figure of a great castle&mdash;brimful of
life&mdash;with which the lesser poets of the age contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
like so many outlying towers, that we can
walk all round about, and measure, and scale, and
tell of their age, and forces, and style; but this
Shakespearean hulk is so vast, so wondrous, so peopled
with creatures, who are real, yet unreal&mdash;that
measure and scale count for nothing. We hear
around it the tramp of armies and the blare of
trumpets; yet these do not drown the sick voice of
poor distraught Ophelia. We see the white banner
of France flung to the breeze, and the English columbine
nodding in clefts of the wall; we hear the
ravens croak from turrets that lift above the
chamber of Macbeth, and the howling of the rain-storms
that drenched poor Lear; and we see Jessica
at her casement, and the Jew Shylock whetting
his greedy knife, and the humpbacked Richard
raging in battle, and the Prince boy&mdash;apart in his
dim tower&mdash;piteously questioning the jailer Hubert,
who has brought “hot-irons” with him.
Then there is Falstaff, and Dame Quickly, and the
pretty Juliet sighing herself away from her moonlit
balcony.</p>

<p>These are all live people to us; we know them;
and we know Hamlet, and Brutus, and Mark Antony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and the witty, coquettish Rosalind; even the
poor Mariana of the moated grange. We do not
see enough of this latter, to be sure, to give stereoscopic
roundness; but the mere glimpse&mdash;allusion&mdash;is
of such weight&mdash;has such hue of realness,
that it buoys the dim figure over the literary
currents and drifts of two hundred and odd years,
till it gets itself planted anew in the fine lines of
Tennyson;&mdash;not as an illusion only, a figment of
the elder imagination chased down and poetically
adopted&mdash;but as an historic actuality we have met,
and so, greet with the grace and the knowingness
of old acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>If you tell me of twenty historic names in these
reigns of Elizabeth and James&mdash;names of men or
women whose lives and characters you know best&mdash;I
will name to you twenty out of the dramas
of Shakespeare whose lives and characters you
know better.</p>

<p>And herein lies the difference between this man
Shakespeare, and most that went before him, or
who have succeeded him; he has supplied real
characters to count up among the characters we
know. Chaucer did indeed in that Canterbury Pilgrimage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
which he told us of in such winning numbers,
make us know by a mere touch, in some unforgetable
way, all the outer aspects of the Knight,
and the Squire, and the Prioress, and the shrewish
Wife of Bath; but we do not see them insidedly;
and as for the Una, and Gloriana, and Britomart,
of the “Faërie Queene,” they are phantasmic; we
may admire them, but we admire them as we admire
fine bird-plumes tossing airily, delightsomely&mdash;they
have no flesh and blood texture: and if I
were to name to you a whole catalogue of the best-drawn
characters out of Jonson, and Fletcher, and
Massinger, and the rest, you would hardly know
them. Will you try? You may know indeed the
Sir Giles Overreach of Massinger, because “A New
Way to Pay Old Debts” has always a certain relish;
and because Sir Giles is a dreadful type of the unnatural,
selfish greed that maddens us everywhere;
but do you know well&mdash;Sejanus, or Tamburlaine,
or Bellisant, or Boadicea, or Bellario, or Bobadil, or
Calantha? You do not even know them to bow to.
And this, not alone because we are unused to read
or to hear the plays in which these characters appear,
but because none of them have that vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
roundness, completeness, and individuality which
makes their memory stick in the mind, when once
they have shown their qualities.</p>

<p>We are, all of us, in the way of meeting people
in respect of whom a week, or even a day of intercourse,
will so fasten upon us&mdash;maybe their pungency,
their alertness, or some one of their decided,
fixed, fine attributes, that they thenceforth people
our imagination; not obtrusively there indeed, but
a look, a name, an allusion, calls back their special
significance, as in a photographic blaze. Others
there are, in shoals, whom we may meet, day by
day, month by month, who have such washed-out
color of mind, who do so take hues from all surroundings,
without any strong hue of their own,
that in parting from them we forget, straightway,
what manner of folk they were. You cannot part
so from the people Shakespeare makes you know.</p>

<h3>Shakespeare’s Youth.</h3>

<p>And now what was the personality of this man,
who, out of his imagination, has presented to us
such a host of acquaintances? Who was he, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
did he live, how did he live, and what about his
father, or his children, or his family retinue?</p>

<p>And here we are at once confronted by the
awkward fact, that we have less positive knowledge
of him, and of his habits of life than of many smaller
men&mdash;poets and dramatists&mdash;who belonged to his
time, and who&mdash;with a pleasant egoism&mdash;let drop
little tidbits of information about their personal
history. But Shakespeare did not write letters that
we know of; he did not prate of himself in his
books; he did not entertain such quarrels with
brother authors as provoked reckless exposure of
the family “wash.” Of Greene, of Nashe, of Dekker,
of Jonson, of Beaumont and Fletcher, we have
personal particulars about their modes of living,
their associates, their dress even, which we seek for
vainly in connection with Shakespeare. This is
largely due, doubtless&mdash;aside from the pleasant
egoism at which I have hinted&mdash;to the circumstance
that most of these were university men, and
had very many acquaintances among those of culture
who kept partial record of their old associates.
But no school associate of Shakespeare ever kept
track of <em>him</em>; he ran out of sight of them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>He did study, however, in his young days, at that
old town of Stratford, where he was born&mdash;his
father being fairly placed there among the honest
tradespeople who lived around. The ancient timber-and-plaster
shop is still standing in Henley Street,
where his father served his customers&mdash;whether
in wool, meats, or gloves&mdash;and in the upper
front chamber of which Shakespeare first saw the
light. Forty odd years ago, when I first visited it,
the butcher’s fixtures were not wholly taken down
which had served some descendant of the family&mdash;in
the female line<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;toward the close of the
eighteenth century, for the cutting of meats. Into
what Pimlico order it may be put to-day, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
hands of the Shakespeare Society, I do not know;
but it is understood that its most characteristic
features are religiously guarded; and house, and
town, and church are all worthy of a visit. The
town does not lie, indeed, on either of those great
thoroughfares which Americans are wont to take on
their quick rush from Liverpool to London, and
the Continent; but it is easily approachable on the
north from Warwick, in whose immediate vicinity
are Kenilworth and Guy’s Cliff; and from the south
through Oxford, whose scores of storied towers and
turrets beguile the student traveller. The country
around Stratford has not, indeed, the varied picturesqueness
of Derbyshire or of Devon; but it
has in full the quiet rural charm that belongs to so
many townships of Middle-England;&mdash;hawthorn
hedges, smooth roads, embowered side lanes, great
swells of greensward where sheep are quietly feeding;
clumps of gray old trees, with rookeries planted
in them, and tall chimneys of country houses lifting
over them and puffing out little wavelets of blue
smoke; meadows with cattle browsing on them;
wayside stiles; a river and canals, slumberous in
their tides, with barges of coal and lumber swaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
with the idle currents that swish among the sedges
at the banks.</p>

<p>On the north, toward Warwick, are the Welcombe
hills, here and there tufted with great trees,
which may have mingled their boughs, in some
early time, with the skirts of the forest of Arden;
and from these heights, looking southwest, one
can see the packed gray and red roofs of the town,
the lines of lime-trees, the elms and the willows of
the river’s margin, out of which rises the dainty
steeple of Stratford church; while beyond, the eye
leaps over the hazy hollows of the Red-horse valley,
and lights upon the blue rim of hills in Gloucestershire,
known as the Cotswolds (which have given
name to one of the famous breeds of English
sheep). More to the left, and nearer to a south
line of view, crops up Edgehill (near to Pilot-Marston),
an historic battle-field&mdash;wherefrom Shakespeare,
on his way to London may have looked
back&mdash;on spire, and alder copse, and river&mdash;with
more or less of yearning. To the right, again, and
more westerly than before, and on the hither side of
the Red-horse valley and plain, one can catch sight
of the rounded thickets of elms and of orcharding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
where nestles the hamlet of Shottery. Thence
Shakespeare brought away his bride, Anne Hathaway,
she being well toward the thirties, and he at
that date a prankish young fellow not yet nineteen.
What means he may have had of supporting a family
at this time, we cannot now say; nor could his
father-in-law tell then; on which score there was&mdash;as
certain traditions run&mdash;some vain demurral. He
may have been associated with his father in trade,
whether as wool-dealer or glover; doubtless was;
doubtless, too, had abandoned all schooling; doubtless
was at all the wakes, and May festivals, and
entertainments of strolling players, and had many
a bout of heavy ale-drinking. There are stories too&mdash;of
lesser authenticity&mdash;that he was over-familiar
with the game in the near Park of Charlecote,
whereby he came to ugly issue with its owner. We
shall probably never know the truth about these
stories. Charlecote House is still standing, a few
miles out of the town (northeasterly), and its delightful
park, and picturesque mossy walls&mdash;dappled
with patches of shadow and with ivy leaves&mdash;look
charmingly innocent of any harm their master
could have done to William Shakespeare; but certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
it is that the neighborhood grew too warm for
him; and that he set off one day (being then about
twenty-three years old) for London, to seek his
fortune.</p>

<h3>Family Relations.</h3>

<p>His wife and three children<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> stayed behind. In
fact&mdash;and it may as well be said here&mdash;they always
stayed behind. It does not appear that throughout
the twenty or more succeeding years, during which
Shakespeare was mostly in London, that either wife
or child was ever domiciled with him there for ever
so little time. Indeed, for the nine years immediately
following Shakespeare’s departure from Stratford,
traces of his special whereabouts are very dim;
we know that rising from humblest work in connection
with companies of players, he was blazing
a great and most noticeable path for himself; but
whether through those nine years he was tied to
the shadow of London houses, or was booked for
up-country expeditions, or (as some reckon) made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
brief continental journeyings, we cannot surely
tell. In 1596, however, on the occasion of his son
Hamnet’s death, he appears in Stratford again, in
the prime of his powers then, a well-to-do man
(buying New Place the year following), his London
fame very likely blazoning his path amid old towns-people&mdash;grieving
over his lost boy, whom he can
have seen but little&mdash;perhaps putting some of the
color of his private sorrow upon the palette where
he was then mingling the tints for his play of “Romeo
and Juliet.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh, my love,</div>
<div class="verse">Death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath</div>
<div class="verse">Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.</div>
<div class="verse">Thou art not conquered; Beauty’s ensign yet</div>
<div class="verse">Is crimson in thy lips, and in thy cheeks,</div>
<div class="verse">And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.</div>
<div class="verse">Why art thou yet so fair?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His two daughters lived to maturity&mdash;both
marrying; the favorite and elder daughter, Susanna,
becoming the wife of Dr. Hall, a well-established
physician in Stratford, who attended the
poet in his last illness, and who became his executor.
Shakespeare was&mdash;so far as known&mdash;watchful
and tender of his children’s interest: nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
is there positive evidence that he was otherwise to
his wife, save such inferences as may be drawn
from the tenor of some of his sonnets, and from
those long London absences, over which it does not
appear that either party greatly repined. Long absences
are not <i lang="la">prima-facie</i> evidence of a lack of domestic
harmonies; do indeed often promote them
in a limited degree; and at worst, may possibly
show only a sagacious disposition to give pleasant
noiselessness to bickerings that would be inevitable.</p>

<p>It is further to be borne in mind, in partial
vindication of Shakespeare’s marital loyalty, that
this period of long exile from the family roof entailed
not only absence from his wife, but also from
father and mother&mdash;both of whom were living
down to a date long subsequent,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and with whom&mdash;specially
the mother&mdash;most affectionate relations
are undoubted. A disloyalty that would have
made him coy of wifely visitings could hardly
harden him to filial duties, while the phlegmatic
indifference of a very busy London man, which
made him chary of home visitings, would go far to
explain the seeming family estrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>But we must not, and cannot reckon the Stratford
poet as a paragon of all the virtues; his long
London absences, for cause or for want of cause&mdash;or
both&mdash;may have given many twinges of pain
to his own mother (of Arden blood), and to the
mother of his children. Yet after the date of his
boy’s death, up to the time of his final return to
Stratford there are evidences of very frequent
home visits, and of large interest in what concerned
his family and towns-people.</p>

<p>His journeyings to and fro, probably on horseback,
may have taken him by way of Edgehill, and
into Banbury (of “Banbury-Cross” buns); or, more
likely, he would have followed the valley of the
Stour by Shipston, and thence up the hills to
Chipping-Norton, and skirting Whichwood Forest,
which still darkens a twelve-mile stretch of land
upon the right, and so by Ditchley and the great
Woodstock Park, into Oxford. I recall these names
and the succession of scenes the more distinctly,
for the reason that some forty years ago I went
over the whole stretch of road from Windsor to
Stratford on foot, staying the nights at wayside
inns, and lunching at little, mossy hostelries, some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
which the poet may possibly have known, and looking
out wonderingly and reverently for glimpses of
wood, or field, or flood, that may have caught the
embalmment of his verse. It was worth getting up
betimes to verify such lines as these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Full many a glorious morning have I seen</div>
<div class="verse">Kissing with golden face the meadows green,</div>
<div class="verse">Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or those others, telling how the gentle day</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Dapples the drowsy East with spots of gray.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Again, there was delightful outlook for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“&mdash;&mdash;a bank whereon the wild thyme blows</div>
<div class="verse">Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows;”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or, perhaps it was the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Summer’s green, all girded up in sheaves”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">that caught the eye; or, yet again, the picturesque
hedge-rows, which,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Like prisoners overgrown with hair</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Put forth disordered twigs;</div>

<div class="verse indent1">“&mdash;&mdash;even mead, which erst brought sweetly forth</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<p>What a wondrous light upon all the landscape
along all the courses of his country journeyings!
Nor can I forbear to tell how such illumination
once made gay for me all the long foot-tramp from
Chipping-Norton to Stratford&mdash;past Long Compton,
and past Shipston (with lunch at the “Royal
George”)&mdash;past Atherton Church, and thence
along the lovely Stour banks, and some weary miles
of grassy level, till the spire of Trinity rose shimmering
in the late sunlight; afterward copses of
elms, and willows clearly distinguishable, and throwing
afternoon shadows on the silvery stretch of the
Avon; then came sight of lazy boats, and of Clopton
bridge, over which I strolled foot-weary, into streets
growing dim in the twilight; coming thus, by a traveller’s
chance, into the court of the Red-Horse Tavern,
and into its little back-parlor, where after dinner
one was served by the gracious hostess with a copy
of Irving’s “Sketch Book” (its Stratford chapter all
tattered and thumb-worn). In short, I had the rare
good fortune to stumble upon the very inn where
Geoffrey Crayon was quartered twenty odd years before,
and was occupying, for the nonce, the very
parlor where he had thrust his feet into slippers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
made a sceptre of the poker, and enjoyed the royalties
of “mine inn.”</p>

<h3>Shakespeare in London.</h3>

<p>But how fares our runaway Shakespeare in
London? What is he to do there? We do not
positively know that he had a solitary acquaintance
established in the city; certainly not one of a high
and helping position. He was not introduced, as
Spenser had been, by Sir Philip Sidney and by
Raleigh to the favor of the Queen. He has no literary
backing of the colleges, or of degrees, or of
learned associates; nay, not being so high placed,
or so well placed, but that his townsmen of most
respectability shook their heads at mention of him.</p>

<p>But he has heard the strolling players; perhaps
has journeyed up in their trail; he has read broadsides,
very likely, from London; we may be sure
that he has tried his hand at verses, too, in those
days when he went courting to the Hathaway cottage.
So he drifts to the theatres, of which there
were three at least established, when he first
trudged along the Strand toward Blackfriars. He
gets somewhat to do in connection with them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
precisely what that is, we do not know. But he
comes presently to be enrolled as player, taking old
men’s parts that demand feeling and dignity. We
know, too, that he takes to the work of mending
plays, and splicing good parts together. Sneered at
very likely, by the young fellows from the universities
who are doing the same thing, and may be,
writing plays of their own; but lacking Shakespeare’s
instinct as to what will take hold of the
popular appetite, or rather&mdash;let us say&mdash;what will
touch the human heart.</p>

<p>There are poems, too, that he writes early in this
town life of his, dedicated to that Earl of Southampton<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
of whom I have already spoken, and into
whose good graces he has somehow fallen. But
the Earl is eight or ten years his junior, a mere boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in fact, just from Cambridge, strangely attracted by
this high-browed, blue-eyed, sandy-haired young
fellow from Stratford, who has shown such keenness
and wondrous insight.</p>

<p>Would you hear a little bit of what he wrote in
what he calls the “first heir of my invention?” It
is wonderfully descriptive of a poor hare who is
hunted by hounds; which he had surely seen over
and again on the Oxfordshire or Cotswold downs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sometimes he runs among a flock of sheep,</div>
<div class="verse">To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,</div>
<div class="verse">And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;</div>
<div class="verse">Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“For there, his smell, with others being mingled,</div>
<div class="verse">The hot-scent snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,</div>
<div class="verse">Ceasing their clamorous cry, till they have singled</div>
<div class="verse">With much ado, the cold fault clearly out;</div>
<div class="verse">Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies</div>
<div class="verse">As if another chase were in the skies.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“By this poor Wat, far off upon a hill,</div>
<div class="verse">Stands on his hinder legs with listening fear,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
<div class="verse">To hearken if his foes pursue him still;</div>
<div class="verse">Anon, their loud alarums he doth hear;</div>
<div class="verse">And now his grief may be comparéd well</div>
<div class="verse">To one sore-sick, that hears the passing bell.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It must have been close upon this that his first
play was written and played, though not published
until some years after. It may have been “Love’s
Labor’s Lost,” it may have been the “Two Gentlemen
of Verona;” no matter what: I shall not enter
into the question of probable succession of his
plays, as to which critics will very likely be never
wholly agreed.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It is enough that he wrote them;
the merry ones when his heart was light, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
tragic ones when grief lay heavily upon him. And
yet this is only partially true; he had such amazing
power of subordinating his feeling to his thought.</p>

<p>I wonder how much of his own hopes and possible
foretaste he did put into the opening lines
of what, by most perhaps, is reckoned his first
play:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Let Fame, that all hunt after in their lives,</div>
<div class="verse">Live registered upon our brazen tombs,</div>
<div class="verse">And then grace us in the disgrace of Death;</div>
<div class="verse">When, spite of cormorant-devouring Time,</div>
<div class="verse">The endeavor of this present breath may buy</div>
<div class="verse">That honor, which shall bate his scythe’s keen edge</div>
<div class="verse">And make us heirs of all Eternity!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Work and Reputation.</h3>

<p>And what was thought of him in those first days?
Not overmuch; none looked upon him as largely
overtopping his compeers of that day. His <cite>Venus
and Adonis</cite><a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> was widely and admiringly known: so
was his <cite>Lucrece</cite>; but Marlowe’s “sound and fury”
in “Tamburlaine” would have very possibly drawn
twice the house of “Love’s Labor’s Lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>He had no coterie behind him; he was hail-fellow
with Jonson; probably knew Peele and Marlowe
well; undoubtedly knew Drayton; he went to
the Falcon and the Mermaid; but there is, I believe,
no certain evidence that he ever saw much of Raleigh,
or of Spenser, who was living some years
after he came to London. It is doubtful, indeed,
if the poet of the <cite>Faery Queene</cite> knew him at all.
Sidney he probably never saw; nor did he ever go,
so far as appears, to dine with the great Francis
Bacon, as Jonson without doubt sometimes did, or
with Burleigh, or with Cecil.</p>

<p>His lack of precise learning may have made him
inapt for encounter with school-men. But he had
a faculty of apprehension that transcended mere
scholastic learning&mdash;apprehending everywhere, in
places where studious ones were blind. I can imagine
that Oxford men&mdash;just up in town or those
who had written theses for university purposes,
would sneer at such show of learning as he made;&mdash;call
it cheap erudition&mdash;call it result of cramming&mdash;as
many university men do nowadays when
they find a layman and outsider hitting anything
that respects learning in the eye. But, ah, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a gift of cramming! What a gift of apprehension!
What a swift march over the hedges that
cramp schools! What a flight, where other men
walked, and were dazed and discomfited by this
unheard-of progress into the ways of knowledge
and of wisdom!</p>

<p>Again, these Shakespeare plays do sometimes
show crude things, vulgar things, coarse things&mdash;things
we want to skip and do skip&mdash;things that
make us wonder if he ever wrote them; perhaps
some which in the mendings and tinkerings of
those and later days have no business there; and
yet he was capable of saying coarse things; he did
have a shrewd eye for the appetites of the groundlings;
he did look on all sides, and into all depths
of the moral Cosmos he was rounding out; and
even his commonest utterances, have, after all, a certain
harmony, though in lowest key, with the general
drift. He is not always, as some of his dramatic
compeers were, on tragic stilts. He is never
under strain to float high.</p>

<p>Then, too, like Chaucer&mdash;his noblest twin-fellow
of English poesy&mdash;he steals, plagiarizes, takes tales
of passion, and love, and wreck, wherever in human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
history he can find them, to work into his purposes.
But even the authors could scarce recognize the
thefts in either case, so glorified are they by the
changes they undergo under these wonder-making
hands.</p>

<p>As with story, so it is with sentiment. This he
steals out of men’s brains and hearts by wholesale.
What smallest poet, whether in print or talk, could
have failed to speak of man’s journey to his last
home? Shakespeare talks of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“That undiscovered country, from whose bourn no traveller returns,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the sentiment is so imaged, and carries such a
trail of agreeing and caressing thoughts, that it
supplants all kindred speech.</p>

<p>“This life,” says Shakespeare, “is but a stage;”
and the commentators can point you out scores of
like similes in older writers&mdash;Erasmus among the
rest, whose utterance seems almost duplicated;
duplicated, indeed, but with a tender music, and a
point, and a breadth, that make all previous related
similes forgotten. Such utterances grow out of
instincts common to us all; but this man, in whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the common instinct is a masterful alembic, fuses
all old teachings, and white-hot they run out of the
crucible of his soul in such beauteous shapes that
they are sought for and gloried in forever after.
Many a Hamlet has soliloquized&mdash;you and I perhaps;
but never a Hamlet in such way as did Shakespeare’s;
so crisp&mdash;so full&mdash;so suggestive&mdash;so marrowy&mdash;so
keen&mdash;so poignant&mdash;so enthralling.</p>

<p>No, no; this man did not go about in quest of
newnesses; only little geniuses do that; but the
great genius goes along every commonest road-side,
looking on every commonest sight of tree or flower,
of bud, of death, of birth, of flight, of labor, of
song; leads in old tracks; deals in old truths, but
with such illuminating power that they all come
home to men’s souls with new penetrative force and
new life in them. He catches by intuition your
commonest thought, and my commonest thought,
and puts them into new and glorified shape.</p>

<h3>His Thrift and Closing Years.</h3>

<p>Again, this Shakespeare of ours, singing among
the stars, is a shrewd, thrifty man; he comes to
have an interest in all those shillings and sixpences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that go into the till of the Globe Theatre; he makes
money. Where he lived in London,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> we do not
definitely know; at one time, it is believed, on the
Southwark side, near to the old Bear-garden,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> but
never ostentatiously; very likely sharing chambers
with his brother Edmond, who was much time an
actor there;<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> he buys a house and haberdasher’s
shop somewhere near Blackfriars; and he had previously
bought, with his savings&mdash;even before
Queen Elizabeth was dead&mdash;a great house in
Stratford. This he afterwards equips by purchase
of outlying lands&mdash;a hundred acres at one time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and twenty and more at another. He has never
forgotten and never forgotten to love, country sights
and sounds. These journeyings to and fro along
the Oxford and Uxbridge road (on horseback probably),
from which he can see sheer over hedges, and
note every fieldfare, every lark rising to its morning
carol, every gleam of brook, have kept alive his old
fondnesses, and he counts surely on a return to
these scenes in his great New Place of Stratford.
He does break away for that Stratford cover, while
the game of life seems still at its best promise;
while Hamlet is still comparatively a new man upon
the boards; does settle himself in that country
home, to gather his pippins, to pet his dogs, to
wander at will upon greensward that is his own.</p>

<p>I wish we had record of only one of his days in
that retirement. I wish we could find even a two-page
letter which he may have written to Ben Jonson,
in London, telling how his time passed; but
there is nothing&mdash;positively nothing. We do not
know how, or by what exposure or neglect his last
illness came upon him and carried him to his final
home, only two years or so after his return to Stratford.
Even that Dr. Hall, who had married his favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
daughter, and who attended him, and who
published a medical book containing accounts of a
thousand and more cases which he thought of consequence
for the world to know about, has no word
to say concerning this grandest patient that his eye
ever fell upon.</p>

<p>He died at the age of fifty-three. No descendant
of his daughter Susanna is alive; no descendant
of his daughter Judith is alive.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The great new
home which he had built up in Stratford is torn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
down; scarce a vestige of it remains. The famous
mulberry-tree he planted upon that greensward,
where, in after years, Garrick and the rest held high
commemorative festival, is gone, root and branch.</p>

<p>Shakespeare&mdash;an old county guide-book tells
us stolidly&mdash;is a name unknown in that region.
Unknown! Every leaf of every tree whispers it;
every soaring skylark makes a carol of it; and
the memory of it flows out thence&mdash;as flows the
Stratford river&mdash;down through all the green valley
of the Avon, down through all the green valley
of the Severn, and so on, out to farthest seas, whose
“multitudinous waves” carry it to every shore.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">We were venturing upon almost sacred ground
when&mdash;in our last chapter&mdash;we had somewhat
to say of the so-called King James’ Bible; of
how it came to bear that name; of those men who
were concerned in its translation, and of certain
literary qualities belonging to it, which&mdash;however
excellent other and possible future Bibles may be&mdash;will
be pretty sure to keep it alive for a very long
time to come. Next, I spoke of that king of the
dramatists who was born at Stratford. We followed
him up to London; tracked him awhile there; talked
of a few familiar aspects of his life and character;
spared you the recital of a world of things&mdash;conjectural
or eulogistic&mdash;which might be said of him;
and finally saw him go back to his old home upon
the Avon, to play the retired gentleman&mdash;last of all
his plays&mdash;and to die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>This made a great coupling of topics for one
chapter&mdash;Shakespeare and the English Bible! No
two titles in our whole range of talks can or should
so interest those who are alive to the felicities of
English forms of speech, and who are eager to compass
and enjoy its largest and keenest and simplest
forces of phrase. No other vocabulary of
words, and no other exemplar of the aptitudes of
language, than can be found in Shakespeare and in
the English Bible are needed by those who would
equip their English speech for its widest reach,
and with its subtlest or sharpest powers. Out of
those twin treasuries the student may dredge all
the words he wants, and all the turns of expression
that will be helpful, in the writing of a two-page
letter or in the unfolding of an epic. Other books
may make needful reservoir of facts, or record of
theories, or of literary experimentation; but these
twain furnish sufficient lingual armament for all
new conquests in letters.</p>

<p>We find ourselves to-day amid a great hurly-burly
of dramatists, poets, prose-writers, among whom
we have to pick our way&mdash;making a descriptive
dash at some few of them&mdash;seeing the old pedant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of a king growing more slipshod and more shaky,
till at last he yields the throne to that unfortunate
son of his, Charles I., in whose time we shall find
some new singing-birds in the fields of British
poesy, and birds of a different strain.</p>

<h3>Webster, Ford, and Others.</h3>

<p>All those lesser dramatists going immediately before
Shakespeare, and coming immediately after or
with him, may be counted in literary significance
only as the trail to that grander figure which swung
so high in the Elizabethan heavens; many a one
among the lesser men has written something which
has the true poetic ring in it, and is to be treasured;
but ring however loudly it may, and however
musically it may, it will very likely have a
larger and richer echo somewhere in Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Among the names of those contemporaries whose
names are sure of long survival may be mentioned
John Webster; a Londoner in all probability; working
at plays early in the seventeenth century; his
name appearing on various title-pages up to 1624
certainly&mdash;one time as “merchant tailor;” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
there are other intimations that he may have held
some church “clerkship;” but we know positively
very little of him. Throughout the eighteenth century
his name and fame<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> had slipped away from
people’s knowledge; somewhere about the year
1800 Charles Lamb gave forth his mellow piping
of the dramatist’s deservings; a quarter of a century
later Mr. Dyce<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> wrote and published what
was virtually a resurrection work for Webster; and
in our time the swift-spoken Swinburne transcends
all the old conventionalities of encyclopædic writing
in declaring this dramatist to be “hardly excelled
for unflagging energy of impression and of
pathos in all the poetic literature of the world.”</p>

<p>Webster was not a jocund man; he seems to
have taken life in a hard way; he swears at fate.
Humane and pathetic touches there may be in his
plays; but he has a dolorous way of putting all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
humanities to simmer in a great broth of crime.
At least this may not be unfairly said of his chiefest
works, and those by which he is best known&mdash;the
“Vittoria Corombona” and the “Duchess of Malfi.”
There are blood-curdling scenes in them through
which one is led by a guidance that is as strenuous
as it is fascinating. The drapery is in awful keeping
with the trend of the story; the easy murders
hardly appal one, and the breezes that fan the air
seem to come from the flutter of bat-like, leaden
wings, hiding the blue. There are, indeed, wondrous
flashes of dramatic power; by whiles, too,
there are refreshing openings-out to the light or sinlessness
of common day&mdash;a lifting of thought and
consciousness up from the great welter of crime
and crime’s entanglements; but there is little
brightness, sparse sunshine, rare panoply of green
or blooming things; even the flowers are put to
sad offices, and</p>

<div class="verse indent13">“do cover</div>
<div class="verse">The friendless bodies of unburied men.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When a man’s flower culture gets reduced to such
narrow margin as this it does not carry exhilarating
odors with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>John Ford<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> was another name much coupled in
those and succeeding days with that of Webster;
he was indeed associated with him in some of his
work, as also with Dekker. He was a man of
Devonshire birth, of good family;&mdash;a little over-boastful
of being above any “want for money;”
showing traces, indeed, of coarse arrogance, and
swaying dramatically into coarse brutalities. He,
too, was borne down by enslavement to the red
splendors of crime; his very titles carry such foretaste
of foulness we do not name them. There are
bloody horrors and moral ones. Few read him for
love. Murder makes room for incest, and incest
sharpens knives for murder. Animal passions run
riot; the riot is often splendid, but never&mdash;to my
mind&mdash;making head in such grand dramatic utterance
as crowns the gory numbers of Webster.
There are strong passages, indeed, gleaming out of
the red riotings like blades of steel; now and then
some fine touch of pathos&mdash;of quiet contemplative
brooding&mdash;lying amid the fiery wrack, like a
violet on banks drenched with turbid floods; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
they are rare, and do not compensate&mdash;at least
do not compensate me&mdash;for the wadings through
bloody, foul quagmires to reach them.</p>

<p>Marston&mdash;another John<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>&mdash;if not up to the
tragic level of the two last named, had various
talent; wrote satires, parodies; his <cite>Image of Pygmalion</cite>
had the honor of being publicly burned; he
wrought with Jonson on <cite>Eastward Hoe!</cite> won the
piping praises of Charles Lamb in our century, also
of Hazlitt, and the eulogies of later and lesser critics.
But he is coarse, unequal, little read now. I
steal a piquant bit of his satire on metaphysic study
from <cite>What you Will</cite>; it reminds of the frolic moods
of Browning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<h3>Massinger, Beaumont, and Fletcher.</h3>

<p>Some dozen or more existing plays are attributed
to Philip Massinger,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and he was doubtless
the author of many others now unknown save by
name. Of Wiltshire birth, his father had been dependant,
or <i lang="fr">protégé</i> of the Pembroke family, and
the Christian name of Philip very likely kept alive
the paternal reverence for the great Philip Sidney.
Though Massinger was an industrious writer, and
was well accredited in his time, it is certain that he
had many hard struggles, and passed through many
a pinching day; and at the last it would appear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
he found burial, only as an outsider and stranger,
in that old church of St. Saviours, near to London
Bridge, where we found John Gower laid to rest
with his books for pillow. If Massinger did not
lift his lines into such gleams of tragic intensity as
we spoke of in Webster and in Ford, he gave good,
workman-like finish to his dramas; and for bloody
apparelling of his plots, I think there are murderous
zealots, in his Sforza<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> story at least, who
could fairly have clashed swords with the assassins
of “Vittoria Corombona.” It is a large honor to
Massinger that of all the dramas I have named&mdash;outside
some few of Shakespeare’s&mdash;no one is so
well known to modern play-goers as the “New Way
to Pay Old Debts.” The character of Sir Giles
Overreach does not lose its terrible significance.
In our times, as in the old times,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent8">“He frights men out of their estates,</div>
<div class="verse">And breaks through all law-nets&mdash;made to curb ill men&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">As they were cobwebs.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Massinger died tradition says that he was
thrust into the same grave which had been opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
shortly before for John Fletcher; if not joined
there, these two had certainly been fellows in literary
work; and there are those who think that the
name of Massinger should have recognition in that
great dramatic copartnery under style of Beaumont
and Fletcher.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Certain it is that other
writers had share in the work; among them&mdash;in
at least one instance (that of “Two Noble Kinsmen”)&mdash;the
fine hand of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>But whatever helping touches or of outside
journey-work may have been contributed to that
mass of plays which bears name of Beaumont and
Fletcher, it is certain that they hold of right that
brilliant reputation for deft and lively and winning
dramatic work which put their popularity before
Jonson’s, if not before Shakespeare’s. The coupling
together of this pair of authors at their work
has the air of romance; both were well born;
Fletcher, son of a bishop; Beaumont, son of Sir
Francis Beaumont, of Grace-Dieu (not far away
from Ashby-de-la-Zouch); both were university
men, and though differing in age by eight or nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
years, yet coming&mdash;very likely through the good
offices of Ben Jonson&mdash;to that sharing of home and
work and wardrobe which the old gossip Aubrey<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
has delighted in picturing. They wrought charmingly
together, and with such a nice welding of
jointures, that literary craftsmen, of whatever astuteness,
are puzzled to say where the joinings
lie. In agreement, however, with opinions of best
critics, it may be said that Beaumont (the younger,
who died nine years before his mate) was possessed
of the deeper poetic fervors, while Fletcher
was wider in fertilities and larger in affluence of
diction.</p>

<p>The dramatic horrors of Ford and Webster are
softened in the lines of these later playwrights.
These are debonair; they are lively; they are jocund;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
they tell stories that have a beginning and
an end; they pique attention; there are delicacies,
too, and&mdash;it must be said&mdash;a good many indelicacies;
there are light-virtued women, and marital
infelicities get an easy ripening toward the over-ripeness
and rottenness that is to come in Restoration
times. These twain were handsome fellows,
by Aubrey’s and all other accounts; Beaumont most
noticeably so; and Fletcher&mdash;brightly swarthy,
red-haired, full-blooded&mdash;dying a bachelor and of
the plague, down in the time of Charles I., and
thrust hastily into the grave at St. Saviours, where
Massinger presently followed him.</p>

<p>I must give at least one taste of the dramatic
manner for which both of these men were sponsors.
It is from the well-known play of “Philaster” that
I quote, where Euphrasia tells of the tender discovery
of what stirred her heart:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent4">“My father oft would speak</div>
<div class="verse">Your worth and virtue: And as I did grow</div>
<div class="verse">More and more apprehensive, I did thirst</div>
<div class="verse">To see the man so praised; but yet all this</div>
<div class="verse">Was but a maiden longing, to be lost</div>
<div class="verse">As soon as found; till, sitting in my window</div>
<div class="verse">Printing my thoughts in lawn, I saw a god</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
<div class="verse">I thought (but it was you) enter our gates.</div>
<div class="verse">My blood flew out, and back again as fast</div>
<div class="verse">As I had puffed it forth and sucked it in</div>
<div class="verse">Like breath. Then was I called away in haste</div>
<div class="verse">To entertain you. Never was a man</div>
<div class="verse">Heaved from a sheep-cote to a sceptre, raised</div>
<div class="verse">So high in thoughts as I:</div>
<div class="verse indent8">I did hear you talk</div>
<div class="verse">Far above singing! After you were gone,</div>
<div class="verse">I grew acquainted with my heart, and searched</div>
<div class="verse">What stirred it so. Alas, I found it Love!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nothing better in its way can be found in all
their plays. One mentioning word, however, should
be given to those delightful lyrical aptitudes, by
virtue of which the blithe and easy metric felicities
of Elizabethan days were overlaid in tendrils
of song upon the Carolan times. I wish, too, that
I had space for excerpts from that jolly pastoral of
<cite>The Faithful Shepherdess</cite>&mdash;bewildering in its easy
gaieties, and its cumulated classicisms&mdash;and which
lends somewhat of its deft caroling, and of its arch
conceits to the later music of Milton’s “Comus.”
Another foretaste of Milton comes to us in these
words of Fletcher:&mdash;</p>

<h3>King James and Family.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, how are London and England getting
on with their ram-shackle dotard of a King? Not
well; not proudly. Englishmen were not as boastful
of being Englishmen as in the days when the
virgin Elizabeth queened it, and shattered the Spanish
Armada, and made her will and England’s power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
respected everywhere. James, indeed, had a son,
Prince Henry, who promised far better things for
England, and for the Stuart name, than his pedant
of a father.</p>

<p>This son was a friend of Raleigh’s (would, maybe,
have saved that great man from the scaffold, if he
had lived), a friend, too, of all the high-minded,
far-seeing ones who best represented Elizabethan
enterprise; but he died, poor fellow, at nineteen,
leaving the heirship to that Charles I. whose dismal
history you know. James had also a daughter&mdash;Elizabeth&mdash;a
high-spirited maiden, who,
amid brilliant fêtes made in her honor, married that
Frederic, Elector Palatine, who received his bride
in the magnificent old castle, you will remember
at Heidelberg. There they show still the great
gateway of the Princess Elizabeth, clad in ivy, and
the Elizabeth gardens. ’Twas said that her ambition
and high spirit pushed the poor Elector into
political complications that ruined him, and that
made the once owner of that princely château an
outcast, and almost a beggar. The King, too, by
his vanities, his indifference, and cowardice, helped
largely the discomfiture of this branch of his family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
as he did by his wretched bringing up of
Charles pave the way for that monarch’s march into
the gulf of ruin.</p>

<p>In foreign politics this weak king coquetted in a
childish way&mdash;sometimes with the Catholic powers;
sometimes with the Protestant powers of Middle
Europe; and at home, with a ridiculous sense of
his own importance, he angered the Presbyterians
of Scotland and the Puritans of England by his
perpetual interferences. He provoked the emigration
that was planting, year by year, a New England
west of the Atlantic; he harried the House of Commons
into an antagonism which, by its growth
and earnestness was, by and by, to upset his throne
and family together. His power was the power of
a blister that keeps irritating&mdash;and not like Elizabeth’s&mdash;the
power of a bludgeon that thwacks and
makes an end.</p>

<p>And in losing respect this King gained no love.
Courtiers could depend on his promises as little as
kingdoms. He chose his favorites for a fine coat,
or a fine face, and thereafter, from sheer indolence
yielded to them in everything. In personal habits,
too, he grew more and more unbearable; his doublets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
were all dirtier; his wigs shabbier; his coarse
jokes coarser; his tipsiness frequenter. A foulness
grew up in the court which tempted such men as
Fletcher and Massinger to fouler ways of speech,
and which lured such creatures as Lady Essex to
ruin. A pretty sort of King was this to preach
against tobacco!</p>

<p>James had given up poetry-writing, in which he
occasionally indulged before coming to England;
yet he had poetical tastes; he enjoyed greatly
many of Shakespeare’s plays; Ben Jonson, too, was
a pet of his, and had easy access to royalty, certainly
until his quarrel with the great court architect,
Inigo Jones. But, as in all else, the King’s
taste in poetry grew coarser as he grew older, and
he showed a great liking for a certain John Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
called “the Water-Poet,” a rough, coarse creature,
who sculled boats across the Thames for hire; who
made a foot-trip into Scotland in rivalry of Ben<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Jonson, and who wrote a <cite>Very merry wherry
Voyage from London to York</cite>, and a <cite>Kecksy-Winsey,
or a Lerry-cum-twang</cite>, which you will not
find in your treasures of literature, but which the
leering King loved to laugh over in his cups. Taylor
afterward was keeper of a rollicking, Royalist
tavern in Oxford, and of another in London, where
he died at the age of seventy-four.</p>

<p>Tobacco, first introduced in Raleigh’s early voyaging
times, came to have a little fund of literature
crystallizing about it&mdash;what with histories of its introduction
and properties, and onslaughts upon it.
Bobadil, the braggart, in “Every Man in his
Humor,” says: “I have been in the Indies (where
this herbe growes), where neither myself nor a
dozen gentlemen more (of my knowledge) have
received the taste of any other nutriment, in the
world, for the space of one and twenty weeks, but
Tobacco only. Therefore it cannot be, but ’tis most
Divine.”</p>

<p>There were many curious stories afloat too&mdash;taking
different shapes&mdash;of the great apprehension
ignorant ones felt on seeing people walking
about, as first happened in these times, with smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
pouring from their mouths and noses. In an old
book called <cite>The English Hue and Crie</cite> (printed about
1610), it takes something like this form:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A certain Welchman, coming newly to London, and beholding
one to take Tobacco, never seeing the like before,
and not knowing the manner of it, but perceiving him vent
smoak so fast, and supposing his inward parts to be on fire,
screamed an alarm, and dashed over him a big pot of
Beer.”</p>

</div>

<p>King James’ <cite>Counterblaste to the Use of Tobacco</cite>,
had about the same efficacy with the Welshman’s
beer-pot. But to show the King’s method of arguing,
I give one little whiff of it. Tobacco-lovers of
that day alleged that it cleared the head and body
of ugly rheums and distillations;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But,” says the King, “the fallacy of this argument may
easily appeare, by my late preceding description of the skyey
meteors. For even as the smoaky Vapors sucked up by the
sunne and stay’d in the lowest and colde region of the Ayre,
are there contracted into clouds, and turned into Raine, and
such other watery meteors: so this nasty smoke sucked up
by the Nose, and imprisoned in the cold and moist braines,
is by their colde and wet faculty, turned and cast forth
againe in watery distillations, and so are you made free and
purged of nothing, but <em>that</em> wherewith you wilfully burdened
yourselves.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Is it any wonder people kept on smoking? He
reasoned in much the same way about church matters;
is it any wonder the Scotch would not have
Anglicanism thrust upon them?</p>

<p>The King died at last (1625), aged fifty-nine, at
his palace of Theobalds, a little out of London, and
very famous, as I have said, for its fine gardens;
and these gardens this prematurely old and shattered
man did greatly love; loved perhaps more
than his children. I do not think Charles mourned
for him very grievously; but, of a surety there was
no warrant for the half-hinted allegation of Milton’s
(at a later day) that the royal son was concerned in
some parricidal scheme. There was, however, nowhere
great mourning for James.</p>

<h3>A New King and some Literary Survivors.</h3>

<p>The new King, his son, was a well-built young
fellow of twenty-five, of fine appearance, well taught,
and just on the eve of his marriage to Henrietta of
France. He had a better taste than his father, and
lived a more orderly life; indeed, he was every way
decorous save in an obstinate temper and in absurd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
notions about his kingly prerogative. He loved
play-going and he loved poetry, though not so accessible
as his father had been to the buffoonery of
the water-poet Taylor, or the tipsy obeisance of old
Ben Jonson. For Ben Jonson was still living, not
yet much over fifty, though with his great bulk and
reeling gait seeming nearer seventy; now, too, since
Shakespeare is gone, easily at the head of all the literary
workers in London; indeed, in some sense
always at the head by reason of his dogged self-insistence
and his braggadocio. All the street world<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
knows him, as he swaggers along the Strand to his
new jolly rendezvous at the Devil Tavern, near St.
Dunstan’s, in Fleet Street&mdash;not far off from the
Temple Church&mdash;where he and his fellows meet in
the Apollo Chamber, over whose door Ben has written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Welcome, all who lead or follow</div>
<div class="verse">To the oracle of Apollo!</div>
<div class="verse">Here he speaks out of his pottle</div>
<div class="verse">On the tripos&mdash;his tower-bottle,” etc.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of all we have named hitherto among the Elizabethan
poets, the only ones who would be likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
appear there in Charles I.’s time would be George
Chapman, of the Homer translation; staid and very
old now, with snowy hair; and Dekker&mdash;what time
he was out of prison for debt; possibly, too, John
Marston. Poor Ben Jonson wrote about this time
his last play, which did not take either with courtiers
or the public; whereupon the old grumbler
was more rough than ever, and died a few years
thereafter, wretchedly poor, and was put into the
ground&mdash;upright, tradition says, as into a well&mdash;in
Westminster Abbey. There one may walk over his
name and his crown; and this is the last we shall
see of him, whose swagger has belonged to three
reigns.</p>

<p>Among other writers known to these times and
who went somewhiles to these suppers at the Apollo
was James Howell,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> notable because he wrote so
much; and I specially name him because he was the
earliest and best type of what we should call a hack-writer;
ready for anything; a shrewd salesman,
too, of all he did write; travelling largely&mdash;having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
modern instincts, I think; making small capital&mdash;whether
of learning or money&mdash;reach enormously.
He was immensely popular, too, in his day; a
Welshman by birth, and never wrote at all till past
forty; but afterward he kept at it with a terrible
pertinacity. He gives quaint advice about foreign
travel, with some shrewdness cropping out in it.
Thus of languages he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whereas, for other Tongues one may attaine to speak
them to very good purpose, and get their good will at any
age; the French tongue, by reason of the huge difference
’twixt their writing and speaking, will put one often into fits
of despaire and passion; but the Learner must not be daunted
a whit at that, but after a little intermission hee must come
on more strongly, and with a pertinacity of resolution set
upon her againe and againe, and woo her as one would do a
coy mistress, with a kind of importunity, until he over-master
her: She will be very plyable at last.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then he says, for improvement, it is well to have
the acquaintance of some ancient nun, with whom
one may talk through the grated windows&mdash;for they
have all the news, and “they will entertain discourse
till one be weary, if one bestow on them now and
then some small bagatells&mdash;as English Gloves, or
Knives, or Ribands&mdash;and before hee go over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
hee must furnish himself with such small curiosities.”</p>

<p>The expenses of travel in that day on the Continent,
he says, for a young fellow who has his “Riding
and Dancing and Fencing, and Racket, and
Coach-hire, with apparel and other casual charges
will be about £300 per annum”&mdash;which sum (allowing
for differences in moneyed values) may have
been a matter of $6,000. He says with great aptness,
too, that the traveller must not neglect letter-writing,
which</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“he should do exactly and not carelessly: For letters are
the ideas and truest mirrors of the mind; they show the inside
of a man and how he improveth himself.”</p>

</div>

<h3>Wotton and Walton.</h3>

<p>Another great traveller of these times&mdash;but one
whose dignities would, I suspect have kept him away
from the Devil Tavern&mdash;was Sir Henry Wotton.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
He was a man who had supplemented his university
training by long residence abroad; who had been of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
service to King James (before the King had yet left
Scotland) by divulging to him and defeating some
purposed scheme of poisoning. Wotton was, later,
English ambassador at the brilliant court of Venice,
whence he wrote to the King many suggestions
respecting the improvement of his garden, detailing
Italian methods, and forwarding grafts and rare
seedlings; he was familiar with most European
courts&mdash;hobnobbed with Doges and with Kings,
was a scholar of elegant and various accomplishments,
and the reputed maker of that old and well-worn
witticism about ambassadors&mdash;that “they
were honest men, sent to lie abroad for the good of
their country.” He was, furthermore, himself boastful
of the authorship of this prickly saying, “The
itch of disputation is the scab of the church.”<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
There is also a charming little poem of his&mdash;which
gets place in the anthologies&mdash;addressed to that
Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, whom we encountered
as a bride at the Castle of Heidelberg, and
who became the mother of the accomplished and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
daring Prince Rupert. Such a man as Wotton,
full of anecdote, bristling with wit, familiar with
courts, and one who could match phrases with
James, or Charles, or Buckingham, in Latin, or
French, or Italian, must have been a god-send for
a dinner-party at Theobalds, or at Whitehall. To
crown his graces, Walton<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> tells us that he was an
excellent fisherman.</p>

<p>And this mention of the quiet Angler tempts me
to enroll him here, a little before his time; yet he
was well past thirty when James died, and must
have been busy in the ordering of his draper’s shop
in Fleet Street when Charles I. came to power.
He was of Staffordshire birth, and no millinery of
the city could have driven out of his mind the
pretty ruralities of his Staffordshire home, and the
lovely far-off views of the Welsh hills. His first
wife was grandniece of Bishop Cranmer; he was
himself friend of Dr. Donne, to whom he listened
from Sunday to Sunday; a second wife was sister of
that Thomas Ken who came to be Bishop of Bath
and Wells; so he was hemmed in by ecclesiasticisms,
and loved them as he loved trout. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
warm Royalist always, and lived by old traditions in
Church and State&mdash;not easily overset by Reformers.
No fine floral triumphs of any new gardeners, however
accredited, could blind him to the old glories
of the eglantine or of a damask rose. A good and
quiet friend, a placid book, a walk under trees,
made sufficient regalement for him. These, with a
fishing bout (by way of exceptional entertainment),
and a Sunday in a village church, with the Litany
well intoned, were all in all to him. His book
holds spicy place among ranks of books, as lavender
keeps fresh odor among stores of linen. It is
worth any man’s dalliance with the fishing-craft to
make him receptive to the simplicities and limpidities
of Walton’s <cite>Angler</cite>. I am tempted to say of
him again, what I have said of him before in other
connection:&mdash;very few fine writers of our time
could make a better book on such a subject to-day,
with all the added information and all the practice
of the newspaper columns. What Walton wants to
say, he says. You can make no mistake about his
meaning; all is as lucid as the water of a spring.
He does not play upon your wonderment with
tropes. There is no chicane of the pen; he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
some pleasant matters to tell of, and he tells of
them&mdash;straight.</p>

<p>Another great charm about Walton is his childlike
truthfulness. I think he is almost the only
earnest trout-fisher (unless Sir Humphry Davy be
excepted) whose report could be relied upon for
the weight of a trout. I have many excellent
friends&mdash;capital fishermen&mdash;whose word is good
upon most concerns of life, but in this one thing
they cannot be religiously confided in. I excuse
it; I take off twenty per cent. from their estimates
without either hesitation, anger, or reluctance.</p>

<p>I must not omit to mention his charming biographic
sketches (rather than “lives”) of Hooker,
of Wotton, of Herbert, of Donne&mdash;the letterpress of
all these flowing easily and limpidly as the brooks
he loved to picture. He puts in very much pretty
embroidery too, for which tradition or street
gossip supplied him with his needs, in figure and
in color; this is not always of best authenticity, it
is true;<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but who wishes to question when it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the simple-souled and always honest Walton who is
talking? And as for his great pastoral of <cite>The Complete
Angler</cite>&mdash;to read it, in whatever season, is like
plunging into country air, and sauntering through
lovely country solitudes.</p>

<p>I name Sir Thomas Overbury<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>&mdash;who was the
first, I think, to make that often-repeated joke respecting
people who boasted of their ancestry, saying
“they were like potatoes, with the best part
below ground”&mdash;because he belonged to this period,
and was a man of elegant culture and literary
promise. He was poisoned in the Tower at the instance
of some great people about the court of
James, who feared damaging testimony of his upon
a trial that was just then to come off; and this trial
and poisoning business, in which (Carr) Somerset
and Lady Essex were deeply concerned, made one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the greatest scandals of the scandalous court of
King James. Overbury’s <cite>Characters</cite> are the best
known of his writings, but they are slight; quaint
metaphors and tricksy English are in them, with
a good many tiresome affectations of speech. What
he said of the Dairymaid is best of all.</p>

<h3>George Herbert.</h3>

<p>This is a name which will be more familiar to the
reader, and if he has never encountered the little
olive-green, gilt-edged budget of Herbert’s<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> poems,
he can hardly have failed to have met, on some
page of the anthologies, such excerpt as this about
Virtue:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,</div>
<div class="verse">The bridal of the earth and sky,</div>
<div class="verse">The dew shall weep thy fall to-night;</div>
<div class="verse indent4">For thou must die.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave,</div>
<div class="verse">Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye,</div>
<div class="verse">Thy root is ever in its grave,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">And thou must die.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Only a sweet and virtuous soul,</div>
<div class="verse">Like season’d timber, never gives;</div>
<div class="verse">But though the whole world turn to coal,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Then chiefly lives.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And now, that I have quoted this, I wish that I
had quoted another; and so it would be, I suppose,
were I to go through the little book. One cannot
go amiss of lines that will show his tenderness, his
strong religious feeling, his gloomy coloring, his
quaint conceits&mdash;with not overmuch rhythmic grace,
but a certain spiritual unction that commends him
to hosts of devout-minded people everywhere. Yet
I cannot help thinking that he would have been lost
sight of earlier in the swarm of seventeenth-century
poets, had it not been for a certain romantic glow
attaching to his short life. And first, he was a scion
from the old Pembroke stock, born in a great castle
on the Welsh borders, and bred in luxury. He
went to Cambridge for study at a time when he
may have encountered there the grim boy-student,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Oliver Cromwell, or possibly that other fair-faced
Cambridge student, John Milton, who was upon the
rolls eight years later. He was a young fellow of
rare scholarship, winning many honors; was tall,
spare, with an eagle eye; and so he wins upon old
James I., when he comes down on a visit to the
University (the Mother Herbert managing to have
the King see his best points, even to his silken
doublets and his jewelled buckles, of which the lad
was fond). And he is taken into favor, bandies
compliments with the monarch, goes again and again
to London and to court; sees Chancellor Bacon
familiarly&mdash;corrects proofs for him&mdash;and has hopes
of high preferment. But his chief patron dies; the
King dies; and that bubble of royal inflation is at
an end.</p>

<p>It was after long mental struggle, it would seem,
that George Herbert, whom we know as the saintly
poet, let the hopes of court consequence die out of
his heart. But once wedded to the Church his religious
activities and sanctities knew no hesitations.
His marriage even was an incident that had no
worldly or amorous delays. A Mr. Danvers, kinsman
of Herbert’s step-father, thought all the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of the poet, and declared his utter willingness that
Herbert “should marry any one of his nine daughters
[for he had so many], but rather Jane, because
Jane was his beloved daughter.” And to such good
effect did the father talk to Jane, that she, as old
Walton significantly tells us, was in love with the
poet before yet she had seen him. Only four days
after their first meeting these twain were married;
nor did this sudden union bring such disastrous
result as so swift an engineering of similar contracts
is apt to show.</p>

<p>At Bemerton vicarage, almost under the shadow
of Salisbury cathedral, he began, shortly thereafter,
that saintly and poetic life which his verse illustrates
and which every memory of him ennobles. His
charities were beautiful and constant; his love of
the flesh, his early “choler,” and all courtly leanings
crucified. Even the peasants thereabout stayed the
plough and listened reverently (another Angelus!)
when the sounds of his “Praise-bells” broke upon
the air. It is a delightful picture the old Angler
biographer gives of him there in his quiet vicarage
of Bemerton, or footing it away over Salisbury
Plain, to lift up his orison in symphony with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
organ notes that pealed from underneath the arches
of Salisbury’s wondrous cathedral.</p>

<p>Yet over all the music and the poems of this
Church poet, and over his life, a tender gloom lay
constantly; the grave and death were always in his
eye&mdash;always in his best verses. And after some
half-dozen years of poetic battling with the great
problems of life and of death, and a further battling
with the chills and fogs of Wiltshire, that smote him
sorely, he died.</p>

<p>He was buried at Bemerton, where a new church
has been built in his honor. It may be found on
the high-road leading west from Salisbury, and only
a mile and a half away; and at Wilton&mdash;the carpet
town&mdash;which is only a fifteen minutes’ walk beyond,
may be found that gorgeous church, built not
long ago by another son of the Pembroke stock (the
late Lord Herbert of Lea), who perhaps may have
had in mind the churchly honors due to his poetic
kinsman; and yet all the marbles which are lavished
upon this Wilton shrine are poorer, and will sooner
fade than the mosaic of verse builded into <cite>The Temple</cite>
of George Herbert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<h3>Robert Herrick.</h3>

<p>I deal with a clergyman again; but there are
clergymen&mdash;and clergymen.</p>

<p>Robert Herrick<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> was the son of a London goldsmith,
born on Cheapside, not far away from that
Mermaid Tavern of which mention has been made;
and it is very likely that the young Robert, as a
boy, may have stood before the Tavern windows
on tiptoe, listening to the drinking songs that
came pealing forth when Ben Jonson and the rest
were in their first lusty manhood. He studied at
Cambridge, receiving, may be, some scant help from
his rich uncle, Sir William Herrick, who had won
his title by giving good jewel bargains to King
James. He would seem to have made a long stay
in Cambridge; and only in 1620, when our Pilgrims
were beating toward Plymouth shores, do
we hear of him domiciled in London&mdash;learning the
town, favored by Ben Jonson and his fellows, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
apprenticed to the goldsmith craft, certainly
putting jewels into fine settings of verse even then;
some of them with coarse flaws in them, but full of
a glitter and sparkle that have not left them yet.
Nine years later, after such town experiences as we
cannot trace, he gets, somehow, appointment to a
church living down in Devonshire at Dean Prior.
His parish was on the southeastern edge of that
great heathery stretch of wilderness called Dartmoor
Forest: out of this, and from under cool
shadows of the Tors, ran brooks which in the
cleared valleys were caught by rude weirs and
shot out in irrigating skeins of water upon the
grassland. Yet it was far away from any echo of
the Mermaid; old traditions were cherished there;
old ways were reckoned good ways; and the ploughs
of that region are still the clumsiest to be found in
England. There Robert Herrick lived, preaching
and writing poems, through those eighteen troublous
years which went before the execution of
Charles I. What the goldsmith-vicar’s sermons
were we can only conjecture: what the poems
were he writ, we can easily guess from the flowers
that enjewel them, or the rarer “noble numbers”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
which take hold on religious sanctities. This
preacher-poet twists the lilies and roses into bright
little garlands, that blush and droop in his pretty
couplets, as they did in the vicar’s garden of Devon.
The daffodils and the violets give out their
odors to him, if he only writes their names.</p>

<p>Hear what he says to Phyllis, and how the numbers
flow:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The soft, sweet moss shall be thy bed,</div>
<div class="verse">With crawling woodbine overspread:</div>
<div class="verse">By which the silver-shedding streams</div>
<div class="verse">Shall gently melt thee into dreams.</div>
<div class="verse">Thy clothing next, shall be a gown</div>
<div class="verse">Made of the fleeces’ purest down.</div>
<div class="verse">The tongues of kids shall be thy meat;</div>
<div class="verse">Their milk thy drink; and thou shalt eat</div>
<div class="verse">The paste of filberts for thy bread,</div>
<div class="verse">With cream of cowslips butterèd:</div>
<div class="verse">Thy feasting table shall be hills</div>
<div class="verse">With daisies spread and daffodils;</div>
<div class="verse">Where thou shalt sit, and Red-breast by,</div>
<div class="verse">For meat, shall give thee melody.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then again, see how in his soberer and meditative
moods, he can turn the rich and resonant
Litany of the Anglican Church into measures of
sweet sound:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In the hour of my distress,</div>
<div class="verse">When temptations me oppress,</div>
<div class="verse">And when I my sins confess,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Sweet Spirit, comfort me!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When I lie within my bed,</div>
<div class="verse">Sick in heart, and sick in head,</div>
<div class="verse">And with doubts discomforted,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Sweet Spirit, comfort me!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When the house doth sigh and weep,</div>
<div class="verse">And the world is drown’d in sleep,</div>
<div class="verse">Yet mine eyes the watch do keep,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Sweet Spirit, comfort me!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When the passing bell doth toll,</div>
<div class="verse">And the furies in a shoal</div>
<div class="verse">Come, to fright a parting soul,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Sweet Spirit, comfort me!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When the judgment is reveal’d,</div>
<div class="verse">And that opened which was seal’d,</div>
<div class="verse">When to thee I have appeal’d,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Sweet Spirit, comfort me!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, in reading these two poems of such opposite
tone, and yet of agreeing verbal harmonies,
one would say&mdash;here is a singer, serene, devout, of
delicate mould, loving all beautiful things in heaven
and on earth. One would look for a man saintly of
aspect, deep-eyed, tranquil, too ethereal for earth.</p>

<p>Well, I must tell the truth in these talks, so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
as I can find it, no matter what cherished images
may break down. This Robert Herrick was a ponderous,
earthy-looking man, with huge double chin,
drooping cheeks, a great Roman nose, prominent
glassy eyes, that showed around them the red lines
begotten of strong potions of Canary, and the whole
set upon a massive neck which might have been
that of Heliogabalus.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It was such a figure as the
artists would make typical of a man who loves the
grossest pleasures.</p>

<p>The poet kept a pet goose at the vicarage, and
also a pet pig, which he taught to drink beer out
of his own tankard; and an old parishioner, for
whose story Anthony à Wood is sponsor, tells us
that on one occasion when his little Devon congregation
would not listen to him as he thought they
ought to listen, he dashed his sermon on the floor,
and marched with tremendous stride out of church&mdash;home
to fondle his pet pig.</p>

<p>When Charles I. came to grief, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Puritans began to sift the churches, this Royalist
poet proved a clinker that was caught in the
meshes and thrown aside. This is not surprising.
It was after his enforced return to London, and
in the year 1648 (one year before Charles’ execution
at Whitehall), that the first authoritative publication
was made of the <cite>Hesperides, or Works, both
Humane and Divine, of Robert Herrick, Esq.</cite>&mdash;his
clerical title dropped.</p>

<p>There were those critics and admirers who saw in
Herrick an allegiance to the methods of Catullus;
others who smacked in his epigrams the verbal felicities
of Martial; but surely there is no need, in that
fresh spontaneity of the Devon poet, to hunt for
classic parallels; nature made him one of her own
singers, and by instincts born with him he fashioned
words and fancies into jewelled shapes. The
“more’s the pity” for those gross indelicacies which
smirch so many pages; things unreadable; things
which should have been unthinkable and unwritable
by a clergyman of the Church of England. To what
period of his life belonged his looser verses it is
hard to say; perhaps to those early days when,
fresh from Cambridge, Ben Jonson patted him on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the shoulder approvingly; perhaps to those later
years when, soured by his ejection from the Church,
he dropped his Reverend, and may have capped
verses with such as Davenant or Lovelace, and
others, whose antagonism of Puritanism provoked
wantonness of speech.</p>

<p>At the restoration of Charles II., Herrick was reinstated
in his old parish in Devonshire, and died
there, among the meadows and the daffodils, at the
ripe age of eighty-four. And as we part with this
charming singer, we cannot forbear giving place to
this bit of his penitential verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“For these my unbaptizèd rhymes</div>
<div class="verse">Writ in my wild unhallowed times,</div>
<div class="verse">For every sentence, clause, and word</div>
<div class="verse">That’s not inlaid with thee, O Lord;</div>
<div class="verse">Forgive me, God, and blot each line</div>
<div class="verse">Out of my book, that is not thine!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>Revolutionary Times.</h3>

<p>I have given the reader a great many names to
remember to-day; they are many, because we have
found no engrossing one whose life and genius
have held us to a long story. But we should never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
enjoy the great memories except they were set in
the foil of lesser ones, to emphasize their glories.</p>

<p>The writers of this particular period&mdash;some of
whom I have named&mdash;fairly typify and illustrate
the drift of letters away from the outspoken ardors
and full-toned high exuberance of Elizabethan
days, to something more coy, more schooled,
more reticent, more measured, more tame.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The
cunning of word arrangement comes into the
place of spontaneous, maybe vulgar wit; humor
is saddled with school-craftiness; melodious echoes
take the place of fresh bursts of sound. Poetry,
that gurgled out by its own wilful laws of
progression, now runs more in channels that old
laws have marked. Words and language that had
been used to tell straightforwardly stories of love
and passion and suffering are now put to uses of
pomp and decoration.</p>

<p>Moreover, in Elizabethan times, when a great
monarch and great ministers held the reins of
power undisturbed and with a knightly hand, minstrelsy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
wherever it might lift its voice, had the
backing and the fostering support of great tranquillity
and great national pride. In the days when the
Armada was crushed, when British ships and British
navigators brought every year tales of gold,
tales of marvellous new shores, when princes of the
proudest courts came flocking to pay suit to England’s
great Virgin Queen, what poet should not
sing at his loudest and his bravest? But in the
times into which we have now drifted, there is no
tranquillity; the fever of Puritans against Anglicans,
of Independents against Monarchy Men, is
raging through all the land; pride in the kingship
of such as James I. had broken down; pride in the
kingship of the decorous Charles I. has broken
down again. All intellectual ardors run into the
channels of the new strifes. Only through little
rifts in the stormy sky do the sunny gleams of
poesy break in.</p>

<p>There are colonies, too, planted over seas, and
growing apace in these days, whither the eyes and
thoughts of many of the bravest and clearest thinkers
are turning. Even George Herbert, warmest of
Anglicans, and of the noble house of Pembroke, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
used to say, “Religion<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> is going over seas.” They
were earnest, hard workers, to be sure, who went&mdash;keen-thoughted&mdash;far-seeing&mdash;most
diligent&mdash;not
up to poems indeed, save some little occasional
burst of melodious thanksgiving. But they carried
memories of the best and of the strongest that belonged
to the intellectual life of England. The
ponderous periods of Richard Hooker, and the
harshly worded wise things of John Selden,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> found
lodgement in souls that were battling with the
snows and pine-woods where Andover and Salem
and Newburyport were being planted. And over
there, maybe, first of all, would hope kindle and
faith brighten at sound of that fair young Puritan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
poet, who has just now, in Cambridge, sung his
“Hymn of the Nativity.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>But the storm and the wreck were coming.
There were forewarnings of it in the air; forewarnings
of it in the court and in Parliament; forewarnings
of it in every household. City was to be
pitted against city; brother against brother; and
in that “sea of trouble,” down went the King and
the leaders of old, and up rose the Commonwealth
and the leaders of the new faith.</p>

<p>In our next talk we shall find all England rocking
on that red wave of war. You would think poets
should be silent, and the eloquent dumb; but we
shall hear, lifting above the uproar, the golden language
of Jeremy Taylor&mdash;the measured cadences
of Waller&mdash;the mellifluous jingle of Suckling and
of his Royalist brothers, and drowning all these
with its grand sweep of sound, the majestic organ-music
of Milton.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">I did not hold the reader’s attention long to
the nightmare tragedies of Webster and Ford,
though they show shining passages of amazing
dramatic power. Marston was touched upon, and
that satiric vein of his, better known perhaps than
his more ambitious work. We spoke of Massinger,
whose money-monster, Giles Overreach, makes one
think of the railway wreckers of our time; then
came the gracious and popular Beaumont and
Fletcher, twins in work and in friendship; the former
dying in the same year with Shakespeare, and
Fletcher dying the same year with King James
(1625). I spoke of that Prince Harry who promised
well, but died young, and of Charles, whose sad
story will come to ampler mention in our present
talk. We made record of the death of Ben Jonson&mdash;of
the hack-writing service of James Howell&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the dilettante qualities of Sir Henry Wotton, and of
the ever-delightful work and enduring fame of the
old angler, Izaak Walton. And last we closed our
talk with sketches of two poets: the one, George
Herbert, to whom his priestly work and his saintly
verse were “all in all;” and the other, Robert Herrick,
born to a goldsmith’s craft, but making verses
that glittered more than all the jewels of Cheapside.</p>

<h3>King Charles and his Friends.</h3>

<p>We open this morning upon times when New-England
towns were being planted among the
pine-woods, and the decorous, courtly, unfortunate
Charles I. had newly come to the throne. Had the
King been only plain Charles Stuart, he would
doubtless have gone through life with the reputation
of an amiable, courteous gentleman, not over-sturdy
in his friendships<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>&mdash;a fond father and
good husband, with a pretty taste in art and in
books, but strongly marked with some obstinacies
about the ways of wearing his rapier, or of tying
his cravat, or of overdrawing his bank account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>In the station that really fell to him those obstinacies
took hold upon matters which brought him
to grief. The man who stood next to Charles, and
who virtually governed him, was that George Villiers,
Duke of Buckingham, who by his fine doublets, fine
dancing, and fine presence, had very early commended
himself to the old King James, and now
lorded it with the son. He was that Steenie who
in Scott’s <cite>Fortunes of Nigel</cite> plays the braggadocio of
the court: he had attended Prince Charles upon that
Quixotic errand of his, incognito, across Europe,
to play the wooer at the feet of the Infanta of Spain;
and when nothing came of all that show of gallantry
and the lavishment of jewels upon the dusky heiress
of Castile, the same Buckingham had negotiated the
marriage with the French princess, Henrietta. He
was a brazen courtier, a shrewd man of the world;
full of all accomplishments; full of all profligacy.
He made and unmade bishops and judges, and bolstered
the King in that antagonism to the Commons
of England which was rousing the dangerous indignation
of such men as Eliot and Hampden and
Pym. Private assassination, however, took him off
before the coming of the great day of wrath. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
must not confound this Duke of Buckingham with
another George Villiers, also Duke of Buckingham,
who was his son, and who figured largely in the
days of Charles II.&mdash;being even more witty, and
more graceful, and more profligate&mdash;if possible&mdash;than
his father; a literary man withal, and the author
of a play<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> which had great vogue.</p>

<p>Another striking figure about the court of
Charles was a small, red-faced man, keen-eyed,
sanctimonious, who had risen from the humble
ranks (his father having been a clothier in a small
town of Berkshire) to the position of Archbishop
of Canterbury. So starched was he in his High-Church
views that the Pope had offered him the hat
of a cardinal. He made the times hard for Non-conformists;
your ancestors and mine, if they emigrated
in those days, may very likely have been
pushed over seas by the edicts of Archbishop Laud.
His monstrous intolerance was provoking, and intensifying
that agitation in the religious world of
England which Buckingham had already provoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in the political world; and the days of wrath were
coming.</p>

<p>This Archbishop Laud is not only keen-sighted
but he is bountiful and helpful within the lines of
his own policy. He endowed Oxford with great,
fine buildings. Some friend has told him that a
young preacher of wonderful attractions has made
his appearance at St. Paul’s&mdash;down on a visit from
Cambridge&mdash;a young fellow, wonderfully handsome,
with curling locks and great eyes full of expression,
and a marvellous gift of language; and the
Archbishop takes occasion to see him or hear him;
and finding that beneath such exterior there is
real vigor and learning, he makes place for him as
Fellow at Oxford; appoints him presently his own
chaplain, and gives him a living down in Rutland.</p>

<h3>Jeremy Taylor.</h3>

<p>This priest, of such eloquence and beauty, was
Jeremy Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> who was the son of a barber at
Cambridge, was entered at Caius College as sizar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
or charity scholar, just one year after Milton was
entered at Christ College, and from the door of his
father’s shop may have looked admiringly many a
time upon the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“rosy cheeks</div>
<div class="verse">Angelical, keen eye, courageous look,</div>
<div class="verse">And conscious step of purity and pride,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which belonged even then to the young Puritan
poet. But Jeremy Taylor was not a Puritan; never
came to know Milton personally. One became the
great advocate and the purest illustration of the
tenets of Episcopacy in England; and the other&mdash;eventually&mdash;their
most effective and weighty opponent.
In 1640, only one year after Jeremy Taylor
was established in his pleasant Rutland rectory,
Archbishop Laud went to the Tower, not to come
forth till he should go to the scaffold; and in the
Civil War, breaking out presently, Jeremy Taylor
joined the Royalists, was made chaplain to the King,
saw battle and siege and wounds; but in the top of
the strife he is known by his silvery voice and his
exuberant piety, and by the rare eloquence which
colors prayer and sermon with the bloody tinge of
war and the pure light of heaven. He is wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
(as I said), he is imprisoned, and finally, by the
chances of battle, he is stranded in a small country
town near to Caermarthen, in South Wales.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the great storm,” he says, “which dashed the vessel
of the Church all in pieces, I was cast on the coast of
Wales, and in a little boat thought to have enjoyed that rest
and quietness which in England I could not hope for.”</p>

</div>

<p>The little boat he speaks of was the obscure
mountain home where he taught school, and where
he received, some time, visits from the famous John
Evelyn,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> who wrote charming books in these days
about woods and gardens, and who befriended the
poor stranded chaplain. Here, too, he wrote that
monument of toleration, <cite>The Liberty of Prophesying</cite>,
a work which would be counted broad in its
teachings even now, and which alienated a great
many of his more starched fellows in the Church.
A little fragment from the closing pages of this
book will show at once his method of illustration
and his extreme liberality:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When Abraham sat at his tent door, waiting to entertain
strangers, he espied an old man stopping by the way, leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
on his staff, weary with much travel, and who was a
hundred years of age.</p>

<p>“He received him kindly, provided supper, caused him
to sit down; but observing that the old man ate, and prayed
not, neither begged for a blessing on his meat, he asked
him why he did not worship the God of Heaven?</p>

<p>“The old man told him he had been used to worship the
sun only.</p>

<p>“Whereupon Abraham in anger thrust him from his tent.
When he was gone into the evils of the night, God called to
Abraham, and said, ‘I have suffered this man, whom thou
hast cast out, these hundred years, and couldest thou not
endure him one night, when he gave thee no trouble?’
Upon this Abraham fetched the man back and gave him entertainment:
‘Go thou and do likewise,’ said the preacher,
‘and thy charity will be rewarded by the God of Abraham.’”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Jeremy Taylor did not learn this teaching from
Archbishop Laud, but from the <i lang="fr">droiture</i> of his own
conscience, and the kindness of his own heart.
He wrote much other and most delectable matter
in his years of Welsh retirement, when a royal
chaplain was a bugbear in England. He lost sons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
too&mdash;who had gone to the bad under the influences
of that young Duke of Buckingham I mentioned;
but at last, when the restoration of Charles II.
came, he was given a bishopric in the wilds of
Ireland, in a sour, gloomy country, with sour and
gloomy looks all around him, which together,
broke him down at the age of fifty-five. I have
spoken thus much of him, because he is a man to
be remembered as the most eloquent, and the most
kindly, and the most tolerant of all the Church of
England people in that day; and because his treatises
on <cite>Holy Living</cite> and <cite>Holy Dying</cite> will doubtless
give consolation to thousands of desponding souls,
in the years to come, as they have in the years
that are past. He was saturated through and
through with learning and with piety; and they
gurgled from him together in a great tide of mellifluous
language. The ardors and fervors of Elizabethan
days seem to have lapped over upon him in
that welter of the Commonwealth wars. He has
been called the Shakespeare of the pulpit; I should
rather say the Spenser&mdash;there is such unchecked,
and uncheckable, affluence of language and illustration;
thought and speech struggling together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
for precedence, and stretching on and on, in ever
so sweet and harmonious jangle of silvery sounds.</p>

<h3>A Royalist and a Puritan.</h3>

<p>Another Royalist of these times, of a different
temper, was Sir John Suckling:<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> a poet too, very
rich, bred in luxury, a man of the world, who had
seen every court in Europe worth seeing, who
dashed off songlets and ballads between dinners
and orgies; which songlets often hobbled on their
feet by reason of those multiplied days of high living;
but yet they had prettinesses in them which
have kept them steadily alive all down to these
prosaic times. I give a sample from his “Ballad
upon a Wedding,” though it may be over-well
known:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Such as are on a Catharine pear,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The side that’s next the sun.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>

<div class="verse">No sun upon an Easter day</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He was a frequenter of a tavern which stood at
the Southwark end of London Bridge. Aubrey
says he was one of the best bowlers of his time.
He played at cards, too, rarely well, and “did use
to practise by himself abed.” He was rich; he was
liberal; he was accomplished&mdash;almost an “Admirable
Crichton.” His first military service was in
support of Gustavus Adolphus, in Germany. At
the time of trouble with the Scots (1639) he raised
a troop for the King’s service that bristled with
gilded spurs and trappings; but he never did much
serious fighting on British soil; and in 1641&mdash;owing
to what was counted treasonable action in
behalf of Strafford, he was compelled to leave England.</p>

<p>He crossed over to the Continent, wandered into
Spain, and somehow became (as a current tradition
reported) a victim of the Inquisition there, and was
put to cruel torture; a strange subject surely to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
put to the torture&mdash;in this life. He was said to
be broken by this experience, and strayed away,
after his escape from those priest-fangs, to Paris,
where, not yet thirty-five, and with such promise in
him of better things, he came to his death in some
mysterious way: some said by a knife-blade which
a renegade servant had fastened in his boot; but
most probably by suicide. There is, however, great
obscurity in regard to his life abroad.</p>

<p>He wrote some plays, which had more notice
than they should have had; possibly owing to a revival
of dramatic interests very strangely brought
about in Charles I.’s time&mdash;a revival which was
due to the over-eagerness and exaggeration of
attacks made upon it by the Puritans: noticeable
among these was that of William Prynne<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>&mdash;“utter
barrister” of Lincoln’s Inn. “Utter barrister”
does not mean æsthetic barrister, but one
not yet come to full range of privilege.</p>

<p>This Prynne was a man of dreadful insistence
and severities; he would have made a terrific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
schoolmaster. He was the author, in the course of
his life, of no less than one hundred and eighty
distinct works; many of them, it is true, were pamphlets,
but others terribly bulky&mdash;an inextinguishable
man; that onslaught on the drama and
dramatic people, and play-goers, including people
of the Court, called <cite>Histriomastix</cite>, was a foul-mouthed,
close-printed, big quarto of a thousand
pages. One would think such a book could do little
harm; but he was tried for it, was heavily
fined, and sentenced to stand in the pillory and
lose his ears. He pleaded strongly against the
sentence, and for its remission upon “divers passages
[as he says in his petition] fallen inconsiderately
from my pen in a book called <cite>Histriomastix</cite>.”</p>

<p>But he pleaded in vain; there was no sympathy
for him. Ought there to be for a man who writes
a book of a thousand quarto pages&mdash;on any subject?
The violence of this diatribe made a reaction
in favor of the theatre; his fellow-barristers of Lincoln’s
Inn hustled him out of their companionship,
and got up straightway a gay masque to demonstrate
their scorn of his reproof.</p>

<p>They say he bore his punishment sturdily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
though the fumes of his book, which was burned
just below his nose, came near to suffocate him.
Later still, he underwent another sentence for offences
growing out of his unrelenting and imperious
Puritanism&mdash;this time in company with one
Burton (not Robert Burton,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> of the <cite>Anatomy of
Melancholy</cite>), who was a favorite with the people and
had flowers strown before him as he walked to the
pillory. But Prynne had no flowers, and his ears
having been once cropt, the hangman had a rough
time (a very rough time for Prynne) in getting at
his task. Thereafter he was sent to prison in the
isle of Jersey; but he kept writing, ears or no ears,
and we may hear his strident voice again&mdash;hear it
in Parliament, too.</p>

<h3>Cowley and Waller.</h3>

<p>Two other poets of these times I name, because
of the great reputation they once had; a reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
far greater than they maintain now. These
are Abraham Cowley and Edmund Waller.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The
former of these (Cowley) was the son of a London
grocer, whose shop was not far from the home
of Izaak Walton; he was taught at Westminster
School, and at Cambridge, and blazed up precociously
at the age of fifteen in shining verses.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Indeed
his aptitude, his ingenuities, his scholarship,
kept him in the first rank of men of letters all
through his day, and gave him burial between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Spenser and Chaucer in Westminster Abbey. He
would take a humbler place if he were disentombed
now; yet, in Cromwell’s time, or in that of Charles
II., the average reading man knew Cowley better
than he knew Milton, and admired him more. I
give you a fragment of what is counted his best;
it is from his “Hymn to Light:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When, Goddess, thou lift’st up thy waken’d head</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Out of the morning’s purple bed,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thy quire of birds about thee play,</div>
<div class="verse">And all the joyful world salutes the rising day.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“All the world’s bravery, that delights our eyes,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Is but thy sev’ral liveries,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Thou the rich dye on them bestowest,</div>
<div class="verse">Thy nimble pencil paints this landscape as thou goest.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A crimson garment in the Rose thou wear’st;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A crown of studded gold thou bear’st,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The virgin lilies in their white,</div>
<div class="verse">Are clad but with the lawn of almost naked light!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If I were to read a fragment from Tennyson in
contrast with Cowley’s treatment of a similar theme
I think you might wonder less why his reputation
has suffered gradual eclipse. Shall we try? Cowley
wrote a poem in memory of a dear friend, and
I take one of the pleasantest of its verses:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ye fields of Cambridge, our dear Cambridge, say,</div>
<div class="verse">Have ye not seen us walking every day?</div>
<div class="verse">Was there a tree about, which did not know</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The love betwixt us two?</div>
<div class="verse">Henceforth, ye gentle trees, for ever fade,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Or your sad branches thicker join,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And into darksome shades combine,</div>
<div class="verse">Dark as the grave wherein my friend is laid.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tennyson wrote of <em>his</em> dead friend, and here is a
verse of it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The path by which we twain did go,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Which led by tracts that pleased us well</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Thro’ four sweet years, arose and fell</div>
<div class="verse">From flower to flower, from snow to snow;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But where the path we walk’d began</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To slant the fifth autumnal slope,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">As we descended, following hope,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>There</em> sat the shadow feared of man,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Who broke our fair companionship,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And spread his mantle dark and cold,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And wrapped thee formless in the fold,</div>
<div class="verse">And dulled the murmur on thy lip,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">And bore thee where I could not see</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Nor follow&mdash;though I walk in haste;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And think&mdash;that somewhere in the waste,</div>
<div class="verse">The shadow sits, and waits for me!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p>Can I be wrong in thinking that under the solemn
lights of these stanzas the earlier poet’s verse grows
dim?</p>

<p>Cowley was a good Kingsman; and in the days
of the Commonwealth held position of secretary to
the exiled Queen Henrietta, in Paris; he did, at
one time, think of establishing himself in one of
the American colonies; returned, however, to his
old London haunts, and, wearying of the city,
sought retirement at Chertsey, on the Thames’
banks (where his old house is still to be seen), and
where he wrote, in graceful prose and cumbrous
verse, on subjects related to country life&mdash;which he
loved overmuch&mdash;and died there among his trees
and the meadows.</p>

<p>Waller was both Kingsman and Republican&mdash;steering
deftly between extremes, so as to keep
himself and his estates free from harm. This will
weaken your sympathy for him at once&mdash;as it
should do. He lived in a grand way&mdash;affected the
philosopher; <em>was</em> such a philosopher as quick-witted
selfishness makes; yet he surely had wonderful
aptitudes in dealing with language, and
could make its harmonious numbers flow where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and how he would. Waller has come to a casual
literary importance in these days under the deft
talking and writing of those dilettante critics who
would make this author the pivot (as it were) on
which British poesy swung away from the “hysterical
riot of the Jacobeans” into measured and
orderly classic cadence. It is a large influence to
attribute to a single writer, though his grace and
felicities go far to justify it. And it is further to
be remembered that such critics are largely given
to the discussion of <em>technique</em> only; they write as
distinct art-masters; while we, who are taking our
paths along English Letters for many other things
besides art and rhythm, will, I trust, be pardoned
for thinking that there is very little pith or weighty
matter in this great master of the juggleries of
sound.</p>

<p>Waller married early in life, but lost his wife
while still very young; thenceforth, for many years&mdash;a
gay and coquettish widower&mdash;he pursued the
Lady Dorothy Sidney with a storm of love verses, of
which the best (and it is really amazingly clever in
its neatness and point) is this:</p>

<h3>John Milton.</h3>

<p>And now we come to a poet of a larger build&mdash;a
weightier music&mdash;and of a more indomitable spirit;
a poet who wooed the world with his songs;
and the world has never said him “Nay.” I mean
John Milton.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>He is the first great poet we have encountered,
in respect to whom we can find in contemporary
records full details of family, lodgement, and birth.
A great many of these details have been swooped
together in Dr. Masson’s recently completed <cite>Life
and Times of Milton</cite>, which I would more earnestly
commend to your reading were it not so utterly
long&mdash;six fat volumes of big octavo&mdash;in the which
the pith and kernel about Milton, the man, floats
around like force meat-balls in a great sea of historic
soup. Our poet was born in Bread Street,
just out of Cheapside, in London, in the year 1608.</p>

<p>In Cheapside&mdash;it may be well to recall&mdash;stood
the Mermaid Tavern; and it stood not more than
half a block away from the corner where Milton’s
father lived. And on that corner&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;the boy, eight years old, or thereby,
when Shakespeare died, may have lingered to see
the stalwart Ben Jonson go tavern-ward for his
cups, or may be, John Marston, or Dekker, or
Philip Massinger&mdash;all these being comfortably inclined
to taverns.</p>

<p>The father of this Bread Street lad was a scrivener
by profession; that is, one who drafted legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
papers; a well-to-do man as times went; able to
give his boy some private schooling; proud of him,
too; proud of his clear white and red face, and his
curly auburn hair carefully parted&mdash;almost a girl’s
face; so well-looking, indeed, that the father employed
a good Dutch painter of those days to take
his portrait; the portrait is still in existence&mdash;dating
from 1618, when the poet was ten, showing him
in a banded velvet doublet and a stiff vandyke collar,
trimmed about with lace. In those times, or
presently after, he used to go to St. Paul’s Grammar
School; of which Lily, of Lily’s <cite>Latin Grammar</cite>,
was the first master years before. It was only a
little walk for him, through Cheapside, and then,
perhaps, Paternoster Row&mdash;the school being under
the shadow of that great cathedral, which was
burned fifty years after. He studied hard there;
studied at home, too; often, he says himself, when
only fourteen, studying till twelve at night. He
loved books, and he loved better to be foremost.</p>

<p>He turns his hand to poetry even then. Would
you like to see a bit of what he wrote at fifteen?
Well, here it is, in a scrap of psalmody:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">For of gods, he is the God,</div>

<div class="verse">For his mercies aye endure,</div>
<div class="verse">Ever faithful, ever sure.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is not of the best, but I think will compare
favorably with most that is written by young
people of fifteen. At Christ’s College, Cambridge,
whither he went shortly afterward&mdash;his father being
hopeful that he would take orders in the
Church&mdash;he was easily among the first; he wrote
Latin hexameters, quarrelled with his tutor (notwithstanding
his handsome face had given to him
the mocking title of “The Lady”), had his season
of <em>rustication</em> up in London, sees all that is doing
in theatrics thereabout, but goes back to study
more closely than ever.</p>

<p>The little Christmas song,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse indent4">“It was the winter wild,</div>
<div class="verse">While the heaven-born Child,” etc.,</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">belongs to his Cambridge life; though his first
public appearance as an author was in the “Ode to
Shakespeare,” attaching with other and various
commendatory verses to the second folio edition
of that author’s dramas, published in the year 1632.</p>

<p>Milton was then twenty-four, had been six or
seven at Cambridge; did not accept kindly his
father’s notion of taking orders in the Church, but
had exaggerated views of a grandiose life of study
and literary work; in which views his father&mdash;sensible
man that he was&mdash;did not share; but&mdash;kind
man that he was&mdash;he did not strongly combat them.
So we find father and son living together presently,
some twenty miles away from London, in a little
country hamlet called Horton, where the old gentleman
had purchased a cottage for a final home
when his London business was closed up.</p>

<p>Here, too, our young poet studies&mdash;not books
only, borrowed where he can, and bought if he can;
but studies also fields and trees and skies and
rivers, and all the natural objects that are to take
embalmment sooner or later in his finished verse.
Here he wrote, almost within sight of Windsor
towers, “L’Allegro” and “Il Penseroso.” You know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
them; but they are always new and always fresh;
freshest when you go out from London on a summer’s
day to where the old tower of Horton Church
still points the road, and trace there (if you can)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“The russet lawns and fallows gray</div>

<div class="verse">And young and old come forth to play</div>
<div class="verse">On a sunshine holiday.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In reading such verse we do not know where to
stop&mdash;at least, I do not. He writes, too, in that
country quietude, within sight of Windsor forest,
his charming “Lycidas,” one of the loveliest of memorial
poems, and the “Comus,” which alone of all
the masques of that time, and preceding times, has
gone in its entirety into the body of living English
literature.</p>

<p>In 1638, then thirty years old, equipped in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
needed languages and scholarship, he goes for further
study and observation to the Continent; he
carries letters from Sir Henry Wotton; he sees the
great Hugo Grotius at Paris; sees the sunny country
of olives in Provence; sees the superb front of
Genoa piling out from the blue waters of the Mediterranean;
sees Galileo at Florence&mdash;the old philosopher
too blind to study the face of the studious
young Englishman that has come so far to greet
him. He sees, too, what is best and bravest at
Rome; among the rest St. Peter’s, just then brought
to completion, and in the first freshness of its great
tufa masonry. He is fêted by studious young Italians;
has the freedom of the Accademia della
Crusca; blazes out in love sonnets to some dark-eyed
signorina of Bologna; returns by Venice, and
by Geneva where he hobnobs with the Diodati
friends of his old school-fellow, Charles Diodati;
and comes home to England to find changes brewing&mdash;the
Scotch marching over the border with
battle-drums&mdash;the Long Parliament portending&mdash;Strafford
and Laud in way of impeachment&mdash;his
old father drawing near to his end&mdash;and bloody
war tainting all the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The father’s fortune, never large, is found crippled
at his death; and Milton, now thirty-two, must
look out for his own earnings. He takes a house;
first in Fleet Street, then near Aldersgate, with
garden attached, where he has three or four
pupils; his nephew Phillips<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> among them.</p>

<h3>Milton’s Marriage.</h3>

<p>It was while living there that he brought back,
one day, a bride&mdash;Mary Powell; she was a young
maiden in her teens, daughter of a well-established
loyalist family near to Oxford. The young bride is
at the quiet student’s house in Aldersgate a month,
perhaps two, when she goes down for a visit to her
mother; she is to come back at Michaelmas; but
Michaelmas comes, and she stays; Milton writes,
and she stays; Milton writes again, and she stays;
he sends a messenger&mdash;and she stays.</p>

<p>What is up, then, in this new household? Milton,
the scholar and poet, is up, straightway, to a
treatise on divorce, whereby he would make it easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to undo yokes where parties are unevenly yoked.
There is much scriptural support and much shrewd
reasoning brought by his acuteness to the overthrow
of those rulings which the common-sense of
mankind has established; even now those who contend
for easy divorce get their best weapons out of
this old Miltonian armory.</p>

<p>Meantime the poet went on teaching, I suspect
rapping his boys over the knuckles in these days
for slight cause. But what does it all mean? It
means incongruity; not the first case, nor will it
be the last. He&mdash;abstracted, austere, bookish, with
his head in the clouds; she&mdash;with her head in ribbons,
and possibly loving orderly housewifery:<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
intellectual affinities and sympathies are certainly
missing.</p>

<p>Fancy the poet just launched into the moulding
of such verse as this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hail, bounteous May, that dost inspire</div>
<div class="verse">Mirth and youth, and warm desire!</div>
<div class="verse">Woods and groves are of thy dressing&mdash;&mdash;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">when a servant gives sharp rat-tat at the door,
“Please, sir, missus says, ‘Dinner’s waiting!’”
But the poet sweeps on&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O nightingale, that on yon blooming spray</div>
<div class="verse">Warblest at eve, when all the woods are still,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou, with fresh heat, the lover’s heart dost fill,</div>
<div class="verse">Now timely sing, ere the rude bird of hate&mdash;&mdash;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And there is another rat-tat!&mdash;“Please, sir, missus
says, ‘Dinner is all getting cold.’” Still the poet
ranges in fairyland&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent8">“&mdash;&mdash;ere the rude bird of hate</div>
<div class="verse">Foretell my hopeless doom, in some grove nigh,</div>
<div class="verse">As thou from year to year hast sung too late</div>
<div class="verse">For my relief, yet hadst no reason why&mdash;&mdash;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And now, maybe, it is the pretty mistress who
comes with a bounce&mdash;“Mr. Milton, are you <em>ever</em>
coming?”&mdash;and a quick bang of the door, which is
a way some excellent petulant young women have
of&mdash;not breaking the commandments.</p>

<p>There is a little prosaic half-line in the “Paradise
Lost” (I don’t think it was ever quoted before),
which in this connection seems to me to have a
very pathetic twang in it; ’tis about Paradise and
its charms&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“No fear lest dinner cool!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p>However, it happens that through the advocacy
of friends on both sides this great family breach is
healed, or seems to be; and two years after, Milton
and his recreant, penitent, and restored wife
are living again together; lived together till her
death; and she became the mother of his three
daughters: Anne, who was crippled, never even
learned to write, and used to be occupied with
her needle; Mary, who was his amanuensis and
reader most times, and Deborah, the youngest,
who came to perform similar offices for him afterward.</p>

<p>Meantime the Royalist cause had suffered everywhere.
The Powells (his wife’s family having come
to disaster) did&mdash;with more or less children&mdash;go
to live with Milton. Whether the presence of
the mother-in-law mended the poet’s domesticity I
doubt; doubt, indeed, if ever there was absolute
harmony there.</p>

<p>On the year of the battle of Naseby appeared
Milton’s first unpretending booklet of poems,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
containing with others, those already named, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
not before printed. Earlier, however, in the lifetime
of the poet had begun the issue of those
thunderbolts of pamphlets which he wrote on
church discipline, education, on the liberty of unlicensed
printing, and many another topic&mdash;cumbrous
with great trails of intricate sentences, wondrous
word-heaps, sparkling with learning, flaming
with anger&mdash;with convolutions like a serpent’s,
and as biting as serpents.</p>

<p>A show is kept up of his school-keeping, but
with doubtful success; for in 1647 we learn that
“he left his great house in Barbican, and betook
himself to a smaller in High Holborn, among those
that open back into Lincoln’s Inn Fields;” but
there is no poem-making of importance (save one
or two wondrous Sonnets) now, or again, until he
is virtually an old man.</p>

<h3>The Royal Tragedy.</h3>

<p>Meantime the tide of war is flowing back and
forth over England and engrossing all hopes and
fears. The poor King is one while a captive of the
Scots, and again a captive of the Parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
forces, and is hustled from palace to castle. What
shall be done with the royal prisoner? There are
thousands who have fought against him who would
have been most glad of his escape; but there are
others&mdash;weary of his doublings&mdash;who have vowed
that this son of Baal shall go to his doom and bite
the dust.</p>

<p>Finally, and quickly too (for events move with
railroad speed), his trial comes&mdash;the trial of a
King. A strange event for these English, who
have venerated and feared and idolized so many
kings and queens of so many royal lines. How the
Royalist verse-makers must have fumed and raved!
Milton, then just turned of forty, was, as I have
said, living near High Holborn; the King was eight
years his senior&mdash;was in custody at St. James’s, a
short way above Piccadilly. He brought to the
trial all his kingly dignity, and wore it unflinchingly&mdash;refusing
to recognize the jurisdiction of
the Parliament, cuddling always obstinately that
poor figment of the divine right of kings&mdash;which
even then Milton, down in his Holborn garden, was
sharpening his pen to undermine and destroy.</p>

<p>The sentence was death&mdash;a sentence that gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
pause to many. Fairfax, and others such, would
have declared against it; even crop-eared Prynne,
who had suffered so much for his truculent Puritanism,
protested against it; two-thirds of the population
of England would have done the same; but
London and England and the army were all in the
grip of an iron man whose name was Cromwell.
Time sped; the King had only two days to live;
his son Charles was over seas, never believing
such catastrophe could happen; only two royal
children&mdash;a princess of thirteen and a boy of eight&mdash;came
to say adieu to the royal prisoner. “He
sat with them some time at the window, taking
them on his knees, and kissing them, and talking
with them of their duty to their mother, and to
their elder brother, the Prince of Wales.” He carried
his habitual dignity and calmness with him on
the very morning, going between files of soldiers
through St. James’s Park&mdash;pointing out a tree
which his brother Henry had planted&mdash;and on,
across to Whitehall, where had come off many a
gay, rollicking masque of Ben Jonson’s, in presence
of his father, James I. He was led through the
window of the banqueting-hall&mdash;the guides show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
it now&mdash;where he had danced many a night,
and so to the scaffold, just without the window,
whence he could see up and down the vast court
of Whitehall, from gate to gate,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> paved with a
great throng of heads. Even then and there
rested on him the same kingly composure; the fine
oval face, pale but unmoved; the peaked beard
carefully trimmed, as you see it in the well-known
pictures by Vandyke, at Windsor or at Blenheim.</p>

<p>He has a word with old Bishop Juxon, who
totters beside him; a few words for others who
are within hearing; examines the block, the axe;
gives some brief cautions to the executioner;
then, laying down his head, lifts his own hand
for signal, and with a crunching thud of sound
it is over.</p>

<p>And poet Milton&mdash;has he shown any relenting?
Not one whit; he is austere among the most austere;
in this very week he is engaged upon his
defence of regicide, with its stinging, biting sentences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
He is a friend and party to the new Commonwealth;
two months only after the execution
of the King, he is appointed Secretary to the State
Council, and under it is conducting the Latin correspondence.
He demolishes, by order of the same
Council, the <cite>Eikon Basilike</cite> (supposed in that day
to be the king’s work) with his fierce onslaught of
the <cite>Eikonoklastes</cite>. His words are bitter as gall; he
even alludes, in no amiable tone&mdash;with acrid emphasis,
indeed&mdash;to the absurd rumor, current with
some, that the King, through his confidential instrument,
Buckingham, had poisoned his own father.</p>

<p>He is further appointed to the answering of Salmasius,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
an answer with which all Europe presently
rings. It was in these days, and with such
work crowding him, that his vision fails; and to
these days, doubtless belongs that noble sonnet on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
his blindness, which is worth our staying for, here
and now:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When I consider how my light is spent</div>
<div class="verse">Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,</div>
<div class="verse">And that one talent, which is death to hide,</div>
<div class="verse">Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent</div>
<div class="verse">To serve therewith my Maker, and present</div>
<div class="verse">My true account, lest he, returning, chide;</div>
<div class="verse">‘Dost God exact day-labor, light denied?’</div>
<div class="verse">I fondly ask: But Patience, to prevent</div>
<div class="verse">That murmur, soon replies&mdash;‘God doth not need</div>
<div class="verse">Either man’s work, or his own gifts; who best</div>
<div class="verse">Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best; his state</div>
<div class="verse">Is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed</div>
<div class="verse">And post o’er land and ocean without rest;</div>
<div class="verse">They also serve, who only stand and wait.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Wonderful, is it not, that such a sonnet&mdash;so full
of rare eloquence and rare philosophy&mdash;so full of
all that most hallows our infirm humanity could be
written by one&mdash;pouring out his execrations on
the head of Salmasius&mdash;at strife in his own household&mdash;at
strife (as we shall find) with his own
daughters? Wonderful, is it not, that Carlyle
could write as he did about the heroism of the
humblest as well as bravest, and yet grow into a
rage&mdash;over his wife’s shoulders and at her cost&mdash;with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a rooster crowing in his neighbor’s yard?
Ah, well, the perfect ones have not yet come upon
our earth, whatever perfect poems they may write.</p>

<h3>Change of Kings.</h3>

<p>But at last comes a new turn of the wheel to
English fortunes. Cromwell is dead; the Commonwealth
is ended; all London is throwing its cap in
the air over the restoration of Charles II. Poor
blind Milton<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> is in hiding and in peril. His name
is down among those accessory to the murder of
the King. The ear-cropped Prynne&mdash;who is now
in Parliament, and who hates Milton as Milton
scorned Prynne&mdash;is very likely hounding on those
who would bring the great poet to judgment. ’Tis
long matter of doubt. Past his house near Red
Lion Square the howling mob drag the bodies of
Cromwell and Ireton, and hang them in their dead
ghastliness.</p>

<p>Milton, however, makes lucky escape, with only a
short term of prison; but for some time thereafter
he was in fear of assassination. Such a rollicking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
daredevil, as Scott in his story of <cite>Woodstock</cite>, has
painted for us in Roger Wildrake (of whom there
were many afloat in those times) would have liked
no better fun than to run his rapier through such a
man as John Milton; and in those days he would
have been pardoned for it.</p>

<p>That capital story of <cite>Woodstock</cite> one should read
when they are upon these times of the Commonwealth.
There are, indeed, anachronisms in it;
kings escaping too early or too late, or dying a little
out of time to accommodate the exigencies of the
plot; but the characterization is marvellously
spirited; and you see the rakehelly cavaliers, and
the fine old king-ridden knights, and the sour-mouthed
Independents, and the glare and fumes
and madness of the civil war, as you find them in
few history pages.</p>

<p>Milton, meanwhile, in his quiet home again, revolves
his old project of a great sacred poem. He
taxes every visitor who can, to read to him in
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Dutch. His bookly appetite
is omnivorous. His daughters have large share of
this toil. Poor girls, they have been little taught,
and not wisely. They read what they read only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
rote, and count it severe task-work. Their mother
is long since dead, and a second wife, who lived
only for a short time, dead too. We know very
little of that second wife; but she is embalmed
forever in a sonnet, from which I steal this fragment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Methought I saw my late espousèd saint</div>
<div class="verse">Brought to me, like Alcestis from the grave;</div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>
<div class="verse">Her face was veiled, yet to my fancied sight</div>
<div class="verse">Love, sweetness, goodness in her person shin’d</div>
<div class="verse">So clear as in no face with more delight.</div>
<div class="verse">But oh, as to embrace me she inclined</div>
<div class="verse">I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Miltonian reading and the work goes on,
but affection, I fear, does not dominate the household;
the daughters overtasked, with few indulgences,
make little rebellions; and the blind,
exacting old man is as unforgiving as the law.
Americans should take occasion to see the great
picture by Munkacsy, in the Lenox Gallery, New
York, of Milton dictating <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>; it is in itself
a poem; a dim Puritan interior; light coming
through a latticed window and striking on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
pale, something cadaverous face of the old poet,
who sits braced in his great armchair, with lips set
together, and the daughters, in awed attention, listening
or seeming to listen.</p>

<p>I am sorry there is so large room to doubt of
the intellectual and affectionate sympathy existing
between them; nevertheless&mdash;that it did not is
soberly true; his own harsh speeches, which are
of record, show it; their petulant innuendoes,
which are also of record, show it.</p>

<p>Into this clouded household&mdash;over which love
does not brood so fondly as we would choose to
think&mdash;there comes sometimes, with helpfulness
and sympathy, a certain Andrew Marvell, who had
been sometime assistant to Milton in his official
duties, and who takes his turn at the readings, and
sees only the higher and better lights that shine
there; and he had written sweet poems of his
own, (to which I shall return) that have kept his
name alive, and that will keep it alive, I think,
forever.</p>

<p>There comes also into this home, in these days,
very much to the surprise and angerment of the
three daughters, a third wife to the old poet, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
some incredibly short courtship.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> She is only
seven years the senior of the daughter Anne; but
she seems to have been a sensible young person,
not bookishly given, and looking after the household,
while Anne and Mary and Deborah still wait,
after a fashion, upon the student-wants of the poet.
In fits of high abstraction he is now bringing the
“Paradise” to a close&mdash;not knowing, or not caring,
maybe, for the little bickerings which rise and
rage and die away in the one-sided home.</p>

<p>I cannot stay to characterize his great poem; nor
is there need; immortal in more senses than one;
humanity counts for little in it; one pair of human
creatures only, and these looked at, as it were,
through the big end of the telescope; with gigantic,
Godlike figures around one, or colossal demons
prone on fiery floods. It is not a child’s book; to
place it in schools as a parsing-book is an atrocity
that I hope is ended. Not, I think, till we have
had some fifty years to view the everlasting fight
between good and evil in this world, can we see in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
proper perspective the vaster battle which, under
Milton’s imagination, was pictured in Paradise between
the same foes. Years only can so widen
one’s horizon as to give room for the reverberations
of that mighty combat of the powers of light and
darkness.</p>

<p>We talk of the organ-music of Milton. The
term has its special significance; it gives hint of
that large quality which opens heavenly spaces with
its billows of sound; which translates us; which
gives us a lookout from supreme heights, and so
lifts one to the level of his “Argument.” There is
large learning in his great poem&mdash;weighty and
recondite; but this spoils no music; great, cumbrous
names catch sonorous vibrations under his
modulating touch, and colossal shields and spears
clash together like cymbals. The whole burden
of his knowledges&mdash;Pagan, Christian, or Hebraic,
lift up and sink away upon the undulations of his
sublime verse, as heavy-laden ships rise and fall
upon some great ground-swell making in from
outer seas.</p>

<p>A bookish color is pervading; if he does not
steal flowers from books, he does what is better&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
shows the fruit of them. There are stories of
his debt to Cædmon, and still more authentic, of
his debt to the Dutch poet Vondel,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and the old
Provençal Bishop of Vienne,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> who as early as the
beginning of the sixth century wrote on kindred
themes. There is hardly room for doubt that
Milton not only knew, but literally translated some
of the old Bishop’s fine Latin lines, and put to his
larger usage some of his epithets.</p>

<p>Must we not admit that&mdash;in the light of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
developments&mdash;when the Puritan poet boasts of
discoursing on</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">that it is due to a little lurking stimulant of that
Original Sin which put bitterness into his Salmasian
papers, and an ugly arrogance into his domestic
discipline? But, after all, he was every way
greater than his forerunners, and can afford to admit
Cædmon and Vondel and Avitus, and all other
claimants, as supporting columns in the underlying
crypt upon which was builded the great temple of
his song.</p>

<h3>Last Days.</h3>

<p>The home of Milton in these latter days of his
life was often changed. Now, it was Holborn
again; then Jewin Street; then Bunhill Row; and&mdash;one
while&mdash;for a year or more, when the great
plague of 1665 desolated the city, he fled before it
to the little village of Chalfont, some twenty miles
distant from London on the Aylesbury road.
There the cottage<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> may still be seen in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
lived, and the garden in which he walked&mdash;but
never saw. There, too, is the latticed window looking
on the garden, at which he sat hour by hour,
with the summer winds blowing on him from over
honeysuckle beds, while he brooded, with sightless
eyes turned to the sky, upon the mysteries of fate
and foreknowledge.</p>

<p>A young Quaker, Ellwood, perhaps his dearest
friend, comes to see him there, to read to him and
to give a helping hand to the old man’s study; his
daughters, too, are at their helpful service; grateful,
maybe, that even the desolation of the plague
has given a short relief from the dingy house in
the town and its treadmill labors, and put the joy
of blooming flowers and of singing birds into their
withered hearts.</p>

<p>The year after, which finds them in Bunhill Row
again, brings that great London fire which the
Monument now commemorates; they passing three
days and nights upon the edge of that huge tempest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of flame and smoke which devoured nearly
two-thirds of London; the old poet hearing the din
and roar and crackle, and feeling upon his forehead
the waves of fierce heat and the showers of cinders&mdash;a
scene and an experience which might have
given, perhaps, other color to his pictures of Pandemonium,
if his great poem had not been just now,
in these fateful years, completed&mdash;completed and
bargained for; £20 were to be paid for it conditionally,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
in four payments of £5 each, at a day
when London had been decimated by the plague,
and half the city was a waste of ruin and ashes.
And to give an added tint of blackness to the picture,
we have to fancy his three daughters leaving
him, as they did, tired of tasks, tired of wrangling.
Anne, the infirm one, who neither read nor wrote,
and Mary, so overworked, and Deborah, the youngest
(latterly being very helpful)&mdash;all desert him.
They never return. “Undutiful daughters,” he
says to Ellwood; but I think he does not soften<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
toward them, even when gone. Poor, stern, old
man! He would have cut them off by will from
their small shares of inheritance in his estate; but
the courts wisely overruled this. Anne, strangely
enough, married&mdash;dying shortly after; Mary died
years later, a spinster; and Deborah, who became
Mrs. Clark, had some notice, thirty years later,
when it was discovered that a quiet woman of that
name was Milton’s daughter. But she seems to
have been of a stolid make; no poetry, no high
sense of dignity belonging to her; a woman like
ten thousand, whose descendants are now said
(doubtfully) to be living somewhere in India.</p>

<p>But Milton wrought on; his wife Betty, of whom
he spoke more affectionately than ever once of his
daughters, humored his poor fagged appetites of the
table. <cite>Paradise Regained</cite> was in hand; and later
the “Samson Agonistes.” His habits were regular;
up at five o’clock; a chapter of the Hebrew Bible
read to him by his daughter Mary&mdash;what time she
stayed; an early breakfast, and quiet lonely contemplation
after it (his nephew tells us) till seven.
Then work came, putting Quaker Ellwood to helpful
service, or whoever happened in, and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
fathom the reading&mdash;this lasting till mid-day dinner;
afterward a walk in his garden (when he had
one) for two hours, in his old gray suit, in which
many a time passers-by saw him sitting at his door.
There was singing in later afternoon, when there
was a voice to sing for him; and instrumental
music, when his, or a friendly hand touched the
old organ. After supper, a pipe and a glass of
water; always persistently temperate; and then,
night and rest.</p>

<p>He attended no church in his later years, finding
none in absolute agreement with his beliefs;
sympathizing with the Quakers to a certain degree,
with the orthodox Independents too; but flaming
up at any procrustean laws for faith; never giving
over a certain tender love, I think, for the organ-music
and storied splendors of the Anglican
Church; but with a wild, broad freedom of thought
chafing at any ecclesiastic law made by man,
that galled him or checked his longings. His
clear, clean intellect&mdash;not without its satiric jostlings
and wrestlings&mdash;its petulancies and caprices&mdash;sought
and maintained, independently, its own
relation with God and the mysterious future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Our amiable Dr. Channing, with excellent data
before him, demonstrated his good Unitarian faith;
but though Milton might have approved his nice
reasonings, I doubt if he would have gone to church
with him. He loved liberty; he could not travel
well in double harness, not even in his household
or with the elders. His exalted range of vision
made light of the little aids and lorgnettes which
the conventional teachers held out to him. Creeds
and dogmas and vestments and canons, and all humanly
consecrated helps, were but Jack-o’-lanterns
to him, who was swathed all about with the glowing
clouds of glory that rolled in upon his soul from
the infinite depths.</p>

<p>In the year 1674&mdash;he being then sixty-five years
old&mdash;on a Sunday, late at night, he died; and with
so little pain that those who were with him did not
know when the end came. He was buried&mdash;not
in the great cemetery of Bunhill Fields, close by his
house&mdash;but beside his father, in the old parish
church of St. Giles, Cripplegate, where he had been
used to go as a boy, and where he had been used to
hear the old burial Office for the Dead&mdash;now intoned
over his grave&mdash;“<cite>Ashes to ashes, dust to dust</cite>.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
There was no need for the monument erected to
him there in recent years. His poems make a monument
that is read of all the world, and will be read
in all times of the world.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">As we launched upon the days of Charles I., in
our last talk, we had somewhat to say of the
King’s advisers, lay and ecclesiastic; we came to
quick sense of the war-clouds, fast gathering,
through which Jeremy Taylor shot his flashes of
pious eloquence; we heard a strain of Suckling’s
verse, to which might have been added other, and
may be better, from such Royalist singers as Carew
or Lovelace;<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> but we cannot swoop all the birds
into our net. We had glimpse of the crop-eared
Prynne of the <cite>Histriomastix</cite>; and from Cowley, that
sincere friend of both King and Queen in the days
of their misfortunes, we plucked some “Poetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Blossoms;” also a charming “Rose,” from the orderly
parterres of that great gardener, and pompous,
time-serving man, Edmund Waller.</p>

<p>Then came Milton with the fairy melodies,
always sweet, of “Comus”&mdash;the cantankerous pamphleteering&mdash;the
soured home-life&mdash;the bloody
thrusts at the image of the King, and the grander
flight of his diviner music into the courts of Paradise.</p>

<h3>Charles II. and his Friends.</h3>

<p>Some fourteen years or so before the death of
Milton, the restoration of Charles II. had come
about. He had drifted back upon the traces of
the stout Oliver Cromwell, and of the feebler Richard
Cromwell, on a great tide of British enthusiasm.
Independents, Presbyterians, Church of England
men, and Papists were all by the ears; and it
did seem to many among the shrewdest of even the
Puritan workers that some balance-wheel (of whatever
metal), though weighted with royal traditions
and hereditary privileges, might keep the governmental
machinery to the steady working of old days.</p>

<p>So the Second Charles had come back, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
great throwing up of caps all through the London
streets; Presbyterians giving him welcome because
he was sure to snub the Independents; the Independents
giving him welcome because he was sure
to snub the Presbyterians; the Church of England
men giving him welcome because he was sure to
snub both (as he did); and finally, the Papists giving
him high welcome because all other ways their
hopes were lean and few.</p>

<p>You know, or should know, what manner of man
he was: accomplished&mdash;in his way; an expert
swordsman; an easy talker&mdash;capable of setting a
tableful of gentlemen in a roar; telling stories
inimitably, and a great many of them; full of grimaces
that would have made his fortune on the stage;
saying sweetest things, and meaning the worst
things; a daredevil who feared neither God nor
man; generous, too&mdash;most of all in his cups; and
liberal&mdash;with other people’s money; hating business
with all his soul; loving pleasure with all his
heart; ready always to do kindness that cost him
nothing; laughing at all Puritans and purity; yet
winning the maudlin affection of a great many people,
and the respect of none.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, the country gentlemen
of England, of good blood, who had sniffed scornfully
at the scent of the beer-vats which hung about
the name of Cromwell, welcomed this clever,
swarthy, black-haired, dissolute Prince, who had a
pedigree which ran back on the father’s side to the
royal Bruce of Scotland, and on the mother’s side
to the great Clovis, and to the greater Charlemagne.</p>

<p>You will find a good glimpse of this scion of
royalty in Scott’s story of <cite>Peveril of the Peak</cite>.
The novel is by no means one of the great romancer’s
best; but it is well worth reading for the clear
and vivid idea it will give one of the social clashings
between the reserves of old Puritanism and the incontinencies
of new monarchism; you will find in
it an excellent sample of the gruff, stalwart Cromwellian;
and another of the hot-tempered, swearing
cavalier; and still others of the mincing, scheming,
gambling, roystering crew which overran all the
purlieus of the court of Charles. Buckingham
was there&mdash;that second Villiers,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> of whom I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
somewhat to say when the elder Buckingham came
up for mention in the days of Charles I.; this
younger Villiers running before the elder in all
accomplishments and all villainies; courtly; of
noble bearing; with daintiest of speeches; a pattern
of manly graces; capable of a tender French song,
with all his tones in exultant accord with best of
court singers, and of a comedy that drew all the
play-goers of London to the “Rehearsal;” capable
too, of the wickedest of plots and of the foulest of
lies. And yet this Buckingham was one of the best
accredited advisers of the Crown.</p>

<p>To the same court belonged Rochester,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> his great,
fine wig covering a great, fine brain; he writing
harmonious verses about&mdash;“Nothing”&mdash;or worse
than nothing; and at the last wheedling Bishop
Burnet into the belief that he had changed his
courses, and that if he might rise from that ugly
deathbed where the good-natured, pompous bishop
sought him, he would be enrolled among the moralists.
I think it was lucky that he died with such
good impulse flashing at the top of his badnesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Dorset belonged to this court, with his pretty
verselets, and Sedley and Etherege; also the Portsmouth
and Lady Castelmaine, and the rest of those
venturesome ladies who show their colors of cheek
and bosom, even now, in the well-handled paintings
of Sir Peter Lely. When you go to Hampton Court
you can see these fair and frail beauties by the
dozen on the walls of the King William room.
Sir Peter Lely<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> was a rare painter, belonging to
these times; a great favorite of Charles; and he
loved such subjects for his brush; he drew the
delicatest hands that were ever put on canvas&mdash;too
delicate and too small, unfortunately, to cover the
undress of his figures.</p>

<p>But, at the worst, England was not altogether a
Pandemonium in those days following upon the
Restoration. I think, perhaps, the majority of historians
and commentators are disposed to over-color
the orgies; it is so easy to make prodigious effects
with strong sulphurous tints and blazing vermilions.
Certain it is that Taine, in writing of these
times, has put an almost malignant touch into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
story, blinking the fact that the trail which shows
most of corrupting phosphorescence came over the
Channel with the new King; forgetting that French
breeding was at the bottom of the new tastes, and
that French gold made the blazonry of the chariots
in which the Jezebels rode on their triumphal way
through London to&mdash;perdition.</p>

<p>Then, again, English vice is more outspoken and
less secretive than that of the over-Channel neighbors.
It is now, and has always been true, that
when his Satanic majesty takes possession of a man
(or a woman), he can cover himself in sweeter and
more impenetrable disguise under the pretty perukes
and charming millinery of French art than
in a homely British body, out of which the demon
horns stick stark through all the wigs and cosmetics
that art can put upon a man.</p>

<p>It is worth while for us to remember that in this
London, when the elegant Duke of Rochester was
beating time with his jewelled hand to a French
gallop, Richard Baxter’s<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> ever-living <cite>Saints’ Rest</cite>
was an accredited book, giving consolation to many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
a poor soul wrestling with the fears of death and of
future judgment. It was published, indeed, somewhat
earlier; but its author was still wakeful and
earnest; and many a time his thin, stooping figure
might be seen threading a way through the street
crowds to his chapel in Southwark, where delighted
listeners came to hear him, almost upon the very
spot where Shakespeare, eighty years before, had
played in the Globe Theatre.</p>

<p>The eloquent Tillotson, too, in these times&mdash;more
liberal than Baxter or Doddridge&mdash;was writing
upon <cite>The Wisdom of Being Religious</cite> and the
right <cite>Rule of Faith</cite>, and by his catholicity and clear-headedness
winning such favor and renown as to
bring him later to the see of Canterbury.</p>

<p>I would have you keep in mind, too, that John
Milton was still alive&mdash;his “Samson Agonistes”
not being published until Charles II. had been
some twelve years upon the throne&mdash;and in quiet
seclusion was cultivating and cherishing that serene
philosophy which glows along the closing line of his
greatest sonnet,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<h3>Andrew Marvell.</h3>

<p>When upon the subject of Milton, I made mention
of a certain poet who used to go and see him in
his country retirement, and who was also assistant
to him in his duties as Latin Secretary to the
Council. This was Andrew Marvell,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> a poet of so
true a stamp, and so true a man, that it is needful
to know something more of him.</p>

<p>He was son of a preacher at Kingston-upon-Hull
(or, by metonomy, Hull) in the north of England.
In a very singular way, the occasion of his father’s
sudden death by drowning (if current tradition
may be trusted) was also the occasion of the young
poet’s entrance upon greatly improved worldly fortune.</p>

<p>The story of it is this, which I tell to fix his
memory better in mind. Opposite his father’s home,
on the other bank of the Humber, lived a lady with
an only daughter, the idol of her mother. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
daughter chanced to visit Hull, that she might be
present at the baptism of one of Mr. Marvell’s children.
A tempest came up before night, and the
boatmen declared the crossing of the river to be
dangerous; but the young lady, with girlish wilfulness
insisted, notwithstanding the urgence of Mr.
Marvell; who, finding her resolved, went with her;
and the sea breaking over the boat both were lost.
The despairing mother found what consolation she
could in virtually adopting the young Andrew Marvell,
and eventually bestowing upon him her whole
fortune.</p>

<p>This opened a career to him which he was not
slow to follow upon with diligence and steadiness.
Well-taught, well-travelled, well-mannered, he went
up to London, and was there befriended by those
whose friendship insured success. He was liberal
in his politics, beautifully tolerant in religious
matters, kept a level head through the years of
Parliamentary rule, and was esteemed and admired
by both Puritans and Royalists. He used a sharp
pen in controversy and wrote many pamphlets,
some of which even now might serve as models for
incisive speech; he was witty with the wittiest; was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
caustic, humorous; his pages adrip with classicisms;
and he had a delicacy of raillery that amused, and
a power of logic that smote heavily, where blows
were in order. He was for a long time member of
Parliament for Hull, and by his honesties of speech
and pen, made himself so obnoxious to the political
jackals about Charles’s court&mdash;that he was said to
be in danger again and again of assassination; he
finally died under strong (but unfounded) suspicion
of poisoning.</p>

<p>Those who knew him described him as “of middling
stature, strong set, roundish face, cherry-cheeked,
hazel-eyed, brown-haired.”<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>There are dainty poems of his, which should be
read, and which are worth remembering. Take
this, for instance, from his <cite>Garden</cite>, which was written
by him first in Latin, and then rendered thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What wondrous life is this I lead!</div>
<div class="verse">Ripe apples drop about my head;</div>
<div class="verse">The luscious clusters of a vine</div>
<div class="verse">Upon my mouth do crush their wine;</div>
<div class="verse">The nectarine and curious peach</div>
<div class="verse">Into my hands themselves do reach;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Stumbling on melons, as I pass,</div>
<div class="verse">Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Here at the fountain’s sliding foot</div>
<div class="verse">Or at some fruit-tree’s mossy root,</div>
<div class="verse">Casting the body’s vest aside</div>
<div class="verse">My soul into the boughs does glide:</div>
<div class="verse">There, like a bird, it sits and sings,</div>
<div class="verse">Then whets and claps its silver wings,</div>
<div class="verse">And, till prepared for longer flight,</div>
<div class="verse">Waves in its plumes the various light.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And this other bit, from his “Appleton House”
(Nuneaton), still more full of rural spirit:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“How safe, methinks, and strong behind</div>

<h3>Author of Hudibras.</h3>

<p>It is altogether a different, and a far less worthy
character that I now bring to the notice of the
reader. The man is Samuel Butler,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and the book
<cite>Hudibras</cite>&mdash;a jingling, doggerel poem, which at the
time of its publication had very great vogue in London,
and was the literary sensation of the hour in
a court which in those same years<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> had received
the great epic of Milton without any noticeable
ripple of applause.</p>

<p>For myself, I have no great admiration for <cite>Hudibras</cite>,
or for Mr. Samuel Butler. He was witty, and
wise in a way, and coarse, and had humor; but he
was of a bar-room stamp, and although he could
make a great gathering of the court people stretch
their sides with laughter, it does not appear that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
had any high sense of honor, or much dignity of
character.</p>

<p>Mr. Pepys (whose memoirs you have heard of,
and of whom we shall have more to tell) says that
he bought the book one day in the Strand because
everybody was talking of it&mdash;which is the only reason
a good many people have for buying books;
and, he continues&mdash;that having dipped into it,
without finding much benefit, he sold it next day in
the Strand for half-price. But poor Mr. Pepys, in
another and later entry, says, “I have bought <cite>Hudibras</cite>
again; everybody does talk so much of it;”
which is very like Mr. Pepys, and very like a good
many other buyers of books.</p>

<p><cite>Hudibras</cite> is, in fact, a great, coarse, rattling, witty
lunge at the stiff-neckedness and the cropped
heads of the Puritans, which the roistering fellows
about the palace naturally enjoyed immensely. He
calls the Presbyterians,</p>

<p>It is not worth while to tell the story of the poem&mdash;which,
indeed, its author did not live to complete.
Its fable was undoubtedly suggested by the
far larger and worthier work of Cervantes; Hudibras
and Ralpho standing in the place of the
doughty Knight of La Mancha, and Sancho Panza;
but there is a world between the two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>Hudibras</cite> had also the like honor of suggesting
its scheme and measure and jingle to an early
American poem&mdash;that of <cite>McFingal</cite>, by John Trumbull&mdash;in
which our compatriot with less of wit and
ribaldry, but equal smoothness, and rhythmic zest,
did so catch the humor of the Butler work in
many of his couplets that even now they pass muster
as veritable parts of <cite>Hudibras</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Samuel Butler was the son of a farmer, over in the
pretty Worcestershire region of England; but there
was in him little sense of charming ruralities;
they never put their treasures into his verse. For
sometime he was in the household of one of Cromwell’s
generals,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> who lived in a stately country-hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a little way out of Bedford; again, he filled some dependency
at that stately Ludlow Castle on the borders
of Wales&mdash;forever associated with the music
of Milton’s “Comus.” It was after the Restoration
that he budded out in his anti-Puritan lampoon;
but though he pandered to the ruling prejudices of
the time, he was not successful in his search for
place and emoluments; he quarrelled with those
who laughed loudest at his buffoonery and died
neglected. His name is to be remembered as
that of one of the noticeable men of this epoch, who
wrote a poem bristling all through with coarse wit,
and whose memory is kept alive more by the stinging
couplets which have passed from his pen into
common speech than by any high literary merit or
true poetic savor. His chief work in verse must be
regarded as a happy, witty extravaganza, which
caused so riotous a mirth as to be mistaken for
valid fame. The poem is a curio of letters&mdash;a specimen
of literary bric-à-brac&mdash;an old, ingeniously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
enamelled snuff-box, with dirty pictures within the
lid.</p>

<h3>Samuel Pepys.</h3>

<p>I had occasion just now to speak of the <cite>Pepys
Diary</cite>, and promised later and further talk about
its author, whom we now put in focus, and shall
pour what light we can upon him.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>He was a man of fair personal appearance and
great self-approval, the son of a well-to-do London
tailor, and fairly educated; but the most piquant
memorial of his life at Cambridge University is the
“admonition”&mdash;which is of record&mdash;of his having
been on one occasion “scandalously over-served
with drink.” In his after life in London he escaped
the admonitions; but not wholly the “over-service”
in ways of eating and drinking.</p>

<p>Pepys was a not far-off kinsman of Lord Sandwich
(whom he strongly resembled), and it was through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that dignitary’s influence that he ultimately came
into a very good position in connection with the
Admiralty, where he was most intrepid in his examination
of tar and cordage, and brought such close
scrutiny to his duties as to make him an admirable
official in the Naval Department under Charles II.
For this service, however, he would never have been
heard of, any more than another straightforward,
plodding clerk; nor would he have been heard of
for his book about naval matters, which you will
hardly find in any library in the country. But he
did write a <cite>Diary</cite>, which you will find everywhere.</p>

<p>It is a <cite>Diary</cite> which, beginning in 1660, the first
of Charles’ reign, covers the ten important succeeding
years; within which he saw regicides hung
and quartered, and heard the guns of terrific naval
battles with the Dutch, and braved all the horrors of
the Great Plague from the day when he first saw
house-doors with a red cross marked on them, and
the words “Lord, have mercy on us!” to the time
when ten thousand died in a week, and “little noise
was heard, day or night, but tolling of bells.” Page
after page of his <cite>Diary</cite> is also given to the great fire
of the following year&mdash;from the Sunday night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
when he was waked by his maid to see a big light
on the back side of Mark Lane, to the following
Thursday when two-thirds of the houses and of the
churches of London were in ashes.</p>

<p>But Pepys’ <cite>Diary</cite> is not so valued for its story of
great events as for its daily setting down of little
unimportant things&mdash;of the plays which he saw
acted&mdash;of the dust that fell on the theatre-goers
from the galleries&mdash;of what he bought, and what
he conjectured, and what his wife said to him,
and what new dresses she had, and how he slept
comfortably through the sermon of Dr. So-and-So&mdash;just
as you and I might have done&mdash;never
having a thought either that his <cite>Diary</cite> would
ever be printed. He wrote it, in fact, in a blind
short-hand, which made it lie unnoticed and undetected
for a great many years, until at last
some prying Cambridge man unriddled his cipher
and wrote out and published <cite>Pepys’ Diary</cite> to the
world. And it is delightful; it is so true and
honest, and straightforward, and gossipy; and it
throws more light upon the every-day life in London
in those days of the Restoration than all the
other books ever written.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>There have been other diaries which have historic
value; there was Hyde, Earl of Clarendon,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> with
some humor and a lordly grace, who wrote a <cite>History
of the Rebellion</cite>&mdash;more than half diary&mdash;with
sentences as long as his pages; but it does not compare
with Pepys’ for flashes of light upon the
accidents of life. There was good, earnest, well-meaning
John Evelyn,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> who had a pretty place
called Says-Court (inherited through his wife) down
at Deptford&mdash;which Scott introduces as the residence
of Essex in his story of <cite>Kenilworth</cite>&mdash;who
had beautiful trees and flowers there which he
greatly loved. Well, John Evelyn wrote a diary,
and a very good one; with perhaps a better description
of the great London fire of 1666 in it
than you will find anywhere else; he gives us, too,
a delightful memorial of his young daughter Mary&mdash;who
read the Ancients, who spoke French and
Italian, who sang like an angel, who was as gentle
and loving as she was wise and beautiful&mdash;whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
death “left him desolate;” but John Evelyn is
silent upon a thousand points in respect to which
Pepys bristles all over like a gooseberry bush. Dr.
Burnet, too, wrote a <cite>History of his Own Times</cite>,
bringing great scholarly attainments to its execution,
and a tremendous dignity of authorship; and
he would certainly have turned up his bishop’s
nose at mention of Samuel Pepys; yet Pepys is
worth a dozen of him for showing the life of that
day. He is so simple; he is so true; he is so unthinking;
he is the veriest photographer. Hear
him for a little&mdash;and I take the passages almost at
random:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>November 9, 1660.</i>&mdash;Lay long in bed this morning.</p>

<p>“To the office, and thence to dinner at the Hoope Tavern,
given us by Mr. Ady and Mr. Wine the King’s fishmonger.
Good sport with Mr. Talbot, who eats no sort of fish, and
there was nothing else till we sent for a neat’s tongue.</p>

<p>“Thence I went to Sir Harry Wright’s, where my Lord
was busy at cards, and so I staid below with Mrs. Carter
and Evans, who did give me a lesson upon the lute, till he
came down, and having talked with him at the door about
his late business of money, I went to my father’s, and staid
late talking with my father about my sister Poll’s coming to
live with me&mdash;if she would come and be as a servant (which
my wife did seem to be pretty willing to do to-day); and he
seems to take it very well, and intends to consider of it.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Home by coach, notwithstanding this was the first day
of the King’s proclamation against hackney coaches coming
into the streets to stand to be hired; yet I got one to carry
me home.”</p>

</div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>11th November, Lord’s Day.</i>&mdash;To church into our
new gallery, the first time it was used. There being no
woman this day, we sat in the foremost pew, and behind
us our servants, and I hope it will not always be so, it
not being handsome for our servants to sit so equal with
us. Afterward went to my father’s, where I found my
wife, and there supped; and after supper we walked home,
my little boy carrying a link [torch], and Will leading my
wife. So home and to prayers and to bed.”</p>

</div>

<p>Another day, having been to court, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Queene, a very little plain old woman, and nothing
more in any respect than any ordinary woman. The Princess
Henrietta is very pretty, but much below my expectation;
and her dressing of herself with her haire frizzed
short up to her eares did make her seem so much the less to
me. But my wife, standing near her, with two or three
black patches on, and well dressed, did seem to me much
handsomer than she. Lady Castelmaine not so handsome
as once, and begins to decay; which is also my wife’s
opinion.”</p>

</div>

<p>One more little extract and I have done:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Lord’s Day, May 26.</i> After dinner I, by water, alone
to Westminster to the Parish Church, by which I had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
great pleasure of seeing and gazing at a great many very
fine women; and what with that, and sleeping, I passed
away the time till sermon was done.”</p>

</div>

<p>Was there ever anything more ingenuous than
that? How delightfully sure we are that such writing
was never intended for publication!</p>

<p>The great charm of Mr. Pepys and all such diary
writing is, that it gives us, by a hundred little gossipy
touches, the actual complexion of the times. We
have no conventional speech to wrestle with, in
order to get at its meaning. The plain white lights
of honesty and common-sense&mdash;so much better
than all the rhetorical prismatic hues&mdash;put the actual
situation before us; and we have an approach
to that realism which the highest art is always
struggling to reach. The courtiers in their great,
fresh-curled wigs, strut and ogle and prattle before
us. We scent the perfumed locks of Peter Lely’s
ladies, and the eels frying in the kitchen. We see
Mr. Samuel Pepys bowing to the Princess Henrietta,
and know we shall hear of it if he makes a
misstep in backing out of her august presence.
How he gloats over that new plush, or moire-antique,
that has just come home for his wife&mdash;cost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
four guineas&mdash;which price shocks him a little, and
sends him to bed vexed, and makes him think he
had better have kept by the old woollen stuff; but,
next Lord’s day being bright, and she wearing it
to St. Margaret’s or St. Giles’, where he watches
her as she sits under the dull fire of the sermon&mdash;her
face beaming with gratitude, and radiant with
red ribbons&mdash;he relents, and softens, and is proud
and glad, and goes to sleep! This Pepys stands a
good chance to outlive Butler, and to outlive Burnet,
and to outlive Clarendon, and to outlive John
Evelyn.</p>

<p>I may add further to this mention of the old
diarist, that at a certain period of his life he became
suspected&mdash;and without reason&mdash;of complicity
with the Popish plots (of whose intricacies you will
get curious and graphic illustration in <cite>Peveril of
the Peak</cite>); and poor Pepys had his period of prisonship
like so many others in that day. He also became,
at a later time, singularly enough, the President
of the Royal Society of England&mdash;a Society
formed in the course of Charles II.s’ reign, and
which enrolled such men as Robert Boyle and Sir
Isaac Newton in its early days; and which now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
enrols the best and worthiest of England’s scientists.</p>

<p>I do not think they would elect such a man as
Samuel Pepys for President now; yet it would appear
that the old gentleman in his long wig and
his new coat made a good figure in the chair, and
looked wise, and used to have the members down
informally at his rooms in York Building, where he
made good cheer for them, and broached his best
bin of claret. Nor should it be forgotten that
Pepys had an appreciative ear for the melodies of
Chaucer (like very few in his day), and spurred
Dryden to the making of some of his best imitations.</p>

<p>When he died&mdash;it was in the early years of
the eighteenth century&mdash;he left his books, manuscripts,
and engravings, which were valuable, to
Magdalen College, Cambridge; and there, as I said
when we first came upon his name, his famous
<cite>Diary</cite>, in short-hand, lay unheard of and unriddled
for more than a hundred years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<h3>A Scientist.</h3>

<p>Science was making a push for itself in these
times. Newton had discovered the law of gravitation
before Charles II. died; the King himself was
no bad dabbler in chemistry.</p>

<p>Robert Boyle, the son of an Earl, and with all
moneyed appliances to help him, was one of the early
promoters and founders of the Royal Society I spoke
of; a noticeable man every way in that epoch of the
Ethereges and the Buckinghams and the Gwynnes&mdash;devoting
his fortune to worthy works; estimable
in private life; dignified and serene; tall in person
and spare&mdash;wearing, like every other well-born Londoner,
the curled, long-bottomed wig of France, and
making sentences in exposition of his thought which
were longer and stiffer than his wigs. I give you a
sample. He is discussing the eye, and wants to say
that it is wonderfully constructed; and this is the
way he says it:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To be told that an eye is the organ of sight, and that
this is performed by that faculty of the mind which, from
its function, is called visive, will give a man but a sorry account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of the instruments and manner of vision itself, or of
the knowledge of that Opificer who, as the Scripture speaks,
formed the eye; and he that can take up with this easy
theory of Vision, will not think it necessary to take the pains
to dissect the eyes of animals, nor study the books of mathematicians
to understand Vision; and accordingly will have
but mean thoughts of the contrivance of the Organ, and the
skill of the Artificer, in comparison of the ideas that will be
suggested of both of them to him, that being profoundly
skilled in anatomy and optics, by their help takes asunder
the several coats, humors, muscles, of which that exquisite
dioptrical instrument consists; and having separately considered
the size, figure, consistence, texture, diaphaneity or
opacity, situation, and connection of each of them, and their
coaptation in the whole eye, shall discover, by the help of
the laws of optics, how admirably this little organ is fitted to
receive the incident beams of light and dispose them in the
best manner possible for completing the lively representation
of the almost infinitely various objects of sight.”</p>

</div>

<p>What do you think of that for a sentence? If
the Fellows of the Royal Society wrote much in
that way (and the Honorable Boyle did a good
deal), is it any wonder that they should have an
exaggerated respect for a man who could express
himself in the short, straight fashion in which Samuel
Pepys wrote his <cite>Diary</cite>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<h3>John Bunyan.</h3>

<p>I have a new personage to bring before you out
of this hurly-burly of the Restoration days, and
what I have to say of him will close up our talk for
this morning.</p>

<p>I think he did never wear a wig. Buckingham,
who courted almost all orders of men, would not
have honored him with a nod of recognition; nor
would Bishop Burnet. I think even the amiable Dr.
Tillotson, or the very liberal Dr. South, would have
jostled away from him in a crowd, rather than toward
him. Yet he was more pious than they; had
more humor than Buckingham; and for imaginative
power would outrank every man living in that
day, unless we except the blind old poet Milton.
You will guess easily the name I have in mind: it is
John Bunyan.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Not a great name then; so vulgar
a one indeed that&mdash;a good many years later&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
amiable poet Cowper spoke of it charily. But it
is known now and honored wherever English is
spoken.</p>

<p>He was born at Elstow, a mile away from Bedford,
amid fat green meadows, beside which in early
May long lines of hawthorn hedges are all abloom.
You will go straight through that pleasant country
in passing from Liverpool to London, if you take,
as I counsel you to do, the Midland Railway; and
you will see the lovely rural pictures which fell
under Bunyan’s eye as he strolled along beside the
hedge-rows, from Elstow&mdash;a mile-long road&mdash;to
the grammar-school at Bedford.</p>

<p>The trees are beautiful thereabout; the grass is
as green as emerald; old cottages are mossy and
picturesque; gray towers of churches hang out a
great wealth of ivy boughs; sleek Durham cattle
and trim sheep feed contentedly on the Bedford
meadows, and rooks, cawing, gather into flocks and
disperse, and glide down singly, or by pairs, into
the tops of trees that shade country houses.</p>

<p>The aspects have not changed much in all these
years; even the cottage of Bunyan’s tinker father is
still there, with only a new front upon it. The boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
received but little schooling, and that at hap-hazard;
but he got much religious teaching from the
elders of the Baptist chapel, or from this or that old
Puritan villager. A stern doctrinal theology overshadowed
all his boyish years, full of threatening,
fiery darts, and full of golden streaks of promise.</p>

<p>He was a badish boy&mdash;as most boys are; a goodly
<i lang="la">quantum</i> of original sin in him; he says, with his
tender conscience, that he was “very bad;” a child
of the devil; swearing, sometimes; playing “three
old cat” very often; picking flowers, I dare say, or
idly looking at the rooks of a Sunday. Yet I would
engage that the Newhaven High School would
furnish thirty or forty as bad ones as John Bunyan
any day in the year. But he makes good resolves;
breaks them again; finally is convicted, but falters;
marries young (and, as would seem, foolishly, neither
bride nor groom being turned of twenty), and she
bringing for sole dower not so much as one dish
or spoon, but only two good books&mdash;<cite>The Plain
Man’s Pathway to Heaven</cite> and <cite>The Practice of Piety</cite>.</p>

<p>Even before this he had been drafted for service
in the battles which were aflame in England&mdash;doubtless
fighting for the Commonwealth, as most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of his biographers<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> allege. Very probably, too, he
was under orders of that Sir Samuel Luke, who lived
near by, and who&mdash;as I have mentioned&mdash;was the
butt of much of Samuel Butler’s Hudibrastic satire.</p>

<p>Next we hear of him as preacher&mdash;not properly
sanctioned even by the non-conforming authorities&mdash;but
opening that intense religious talk of his
upon whatever and whomsoever would come to
hear. Even his friendly Baptist brothers look
doubtfully upon his irregularities; but he sees only
the great golden cross before him in the skies, and
hears only the crackle of the flames in the nethermost
depths below. He is bound to save, in what
way he can, those who will be saved, and to warn,
in fearfullest way, those who will be damned.</p>

<p>Hundreds came to hear this working-man who
was so dreadfully in earnest, and who had no more
respect for pulpits or liturgies than for preaching-places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
in the woods. It was not strange that he offended
against non-conformist acts, nor strange
that, after accession of Charles II. he came to imprisonment
for his illegal pieties. This prison-life
lasted for some twelve years, in the which he still
preached to those who would listen within prison
walls, and read his Bible, and wrought at tagged
laces (still a great industry of that district) for the
support of his family, a separation from whom&mdash;most
of all from his poor blind daughter Mary&mdash;was,
he says, like “pulling the flesh from his
bones.” Over and over in that reach of prison-life
he might have been free if he would have promised
to abstain from his irregular preachments, or if he
would go over seas to America. But he would not;
he could not forbear to warn whomsoever might
hear, of the fiery pit, and of the days when the
heavens should be opened. He loved not the
thought of over-ocean crossing; his duties lay near;
and with all his radicalism he never outlived a gracious
liking for British kingly traditions, and for
such ranking of men and powers as belonged to
Levitical story.</p>

<p>Finally, under Charles’ Declaration of Indulgence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
(1672), which was intended more for the benefit of
ill-used Romanists than for Non-conformists, Bunyan’s
prison-doors were laid open, and he went to
his old work of preaching in public places. There
may have been, as his more recent biographers
intimate, a later (1675) short imprisonment;<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and
this, or some portion of the previous prison-life, was
certainly passed in that ancient Bedford jail, which,
only a few years since, was standing on Bedford
bridge, hanging over the waters of the river Ouse&mdash;whose
slow current we shall find flowing again in
our story of William Cowper.</p>

<p>And if the whole weight of tradition is not to be
distrusted, it was in this little prison over the
river, where passers-by might shout a greeting
to him&mdash;that John Bunyan fell into the dreamy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
fashioning of that book which has made his name
known everywhere, and which has as fixed a place
in the great body of English literature as Shakespeare’s
“Hamlet,” or Spenser’s <cite>Faery Queen</cite>&mdash;I
mean the <cite>Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>.</p>

<p>But how is it, the reader may ask, that this
tinker’s son, who had so far forgotten his school
learning that his wife had to teach him over again
to read and write&mdash;how is it that he makes a
book which takes hold on the sympathies of all
Christendom, and has a literary quality that ranks
it with the first of allegories?<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Pepys told plainly what we wanted him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
tell; but he had nothing but those trifles which
give a color to every-day life to tell of. If he had
undertaken to make a story of a page long, involving
imaginative powers, he would have made a
failure of it; and if he had tried to be eloquent he
would have given himself away deplorably. But
this poor <em>brazier</em> (as he calls himself in his last
will), with not one-fourth of his knowledge of
the world, with not one-twentieth of his learning
(bald as the old diarist was in this line), with
not one-hundredth part of his self-confidence, makes
this wonderful and charming book of which we are
talking. How was it?</p>

<p>Well, there was, first, the great compelling and
informing Christian purpose in him: he was of the
Bible all compact; every utterance of it was a vital
truth to him; the fire and the brimstone were real;
the Almighty fatherhood was real; the cross and
the passion were real; the teeming thousands were
real, who hustled him on either side and who
were pressing on, rank by rank, in the broad road
that leads to the City of Destruction. The man
who believes such things in the way in which
John Bunyan believed them has a tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
motive power, which will make itself felt in some
shape.</p>

<p>Then that limited schooling of his had kept
him to a short vocabulary of the sharpest and
keenest and most telling words. Rhetoric did
not lead him astray after flowers; learning did
not tempt him into far-fetched allusions; literary
habit had not spoiled his simplicities. And again,
and chiefest of all, there was a great imaginative
power, coming&mdash;not from schools, nor from
grammar teachings&mdash;but coming as June days
come, and which, breathing over his pages with an
almost divine afflatus, lifted their sayings into the
regions of Poetry.</p>

<p>Therefore and thereby it is that he has fused
his thought into such shape as takes hold on
human sympathies everywhere, and his characters
are all live creatures. All these two hundred and
twenty years last past the noble Great-heart has
been thwacking away at Giant Grim and thundering
on the walls of Doubting Castle with blows
we hear; and poor, timid Christian has been just
as many years, in the sight of all of us, making
his way through pitfalls and quagmires and Vanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Fairs&mdash;hard pressed by Apollyon, and belabored
by Giant Despair&mdash;on his steady march
toward the Delectable Mountains and the river
of Death, and the shining shores which lie Beyond.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">There were some unsavory names which crept
into the opening of our last chapter; but
they were sweet in the nostrils of Charles II. Of
such were Buckingham, Rochester, Etherege, Dorset,
and the Castelmaine. And we made a little
moral counterpoise by the naming of Baxter’s
<cite>Saints’ Rest</cite>, and of Tillotson, and of the healthful,
noble verse of Andrew Marvell, by which we
wished to impress upon our readers the fact that the
whole world of England in that day was not given
over to French court-dances and to foul-mouthed
poets; but that the Puritan leaven was still working,
even in literary ways, and that there were men
of dignity, knowledge, culture, and rank, who never
bowed down to such as the pretty Duchess of
Portsmouth.</p>

<p>We had our glimpse of that witty buffoon Samuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Butler, who made clever antics in rhyme; and I
think, we listened with a curious eagerness to what
Samuel Pepys had to say of his play-going, and of
the black patches with which his pretty wife set
forth her beauty. Then came Bunyan, with his
great sermonizing in barns and woods, and that far
finer sermonizing which in the days of his jailhood
took shape in the immortal story of Christian and
Great-heart. He died over a grocer’s shop, in
Snow Hill, London (its site now all effaced by the
great Holborn Viaduct), whither he had gone on
a preaching bout in the year 1688, only a few
months before James II. was driven from his
throne. It is worth going out by the City Road&mdash;only
a short walk from Finsbury Square&mdash;to the
cemetery of Bunhill Fields, where Bunyan was
buried&mdash;to see the marble figure of the tinker
preacher stretched upon the monument modern
admirers have built, and to see Christian toiling
below, with his burden strapped to his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<h3>Three Good Prosers.</h3>

<p>In the course of that old <cite>Pepys’ Diary</cite>&mdash;out of
which we had our regalement&mdash;there is several
times mention of Thomas Fuller;<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> among others
this:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I sat down reading in Fuller’s <cite>English Worthies</cite>; being
much troubled that (though he had some discourse with
me about my family and armes) he says nothing at all. But
I believe, indeed, our family were never considerable.”</p>

</div>

<p>Honest Pepys! Shrewd Dr. Fuller, and a man
not to be forgotten! He was a “Cavalier parson”
through the Civil-War days; was born down in
Northamptonshire in the same town where John
Dryden, twenty-three years later, first saw the
light. He was full of wit, and full of knowledges;
people called him&mdash;as so many have been and are
called&mdash;“a walking library;” and his stout figure
was to be seen many a time, in the Commonwealth
days, striding through Fleet Street, and by Paul’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Walk, to Cheapside. There is quaint humor in his
books, and quaintness and aptness of language.
Coleridge says he was “the most sensible and least
prejudiced great man of his time.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> a doctor, and the author of
the <cite>Religio Medici</cite> and <cite>Urn-Burial</cite>, was another delightful
author of the Civil-War times, whose life
reached almost through the reign of Charles II.;
yet he was not a war man&mdash;in matter of kings or
of churches. Serenities hung over him in all those
times wherein cannon thundered, and traitors (so
called) were quartered, and cathedrals despoiled.
He loved not great cities. London never magnetized
him; but after his thorough continental travel
and his doctorate at Leyden, he planted himself in
that old, crooked-streeted city of Norwich, in Norfolk;
and there, under the shadow of the stupendous
mound and Keep (which date from the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Henrys) he built up a home, of which he made a
museum&mdash;served the sick&mdash;reared a family of ten
children, and followed those meditative ways of
thought which led him through sepulchral urns,
and the miracles of growth, and the Holy Scriptures,
away from all the “decrees of councils and the
niceties of the schools” to the altitudes he reaches
in the <cite>Religio Medici</cite>.</p>

<p>I must excerpt something to show the humors of
this Norwich doctor, and it shall be this:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Light that makes things seen makes some things invisible.
Were it not for darkness, and the shadow of the
earth, the noblest part of Creation had remained unseen,
and the stars in Heaven as invisible as on the Fourth day
when they were created above the horizon with the Sun,
and there was not an eye to behold them. The greatest
mystery of Religion is expressed by adumbration, and in the
noblest part of Jewish types we find the Cherubim <em>shadowing</em>
the Mercy Seat. Life itself is but the Shadow of Death,
and souls departed but the Shadows of the Living. The
sun itself is but the dark <em>Simulacrum</em>, and light but the
shadow of God.”</p>

</div>

<p>If there were no other reason for our love of the
best writings of Sir Thomas Browne, it would be
for this&mdash;that in some scarce distinguishable way
he has inoculated our “Elia” of a later day with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
something very like his own quaint egoisms and
as quaint garniture of speech. How Charles Lamb
must have enjoyed him, and joyed in the meditation&mdash;of
a twilight&mdash;on the far-reaching, mystic
skeins of thought which so keen a reader would
ravel out from the stores of the <cite>Urn-Burial</cite>! And
with what delighted sanction the later writer permits,
here and there, the tender solemnities of the
elder to shine through and qualify his own periods;
not through imitativeness, conscious or unconscious,
but because the juices from the mellow
fruitage of the old physician have been quietly assimilated
by the stuttering clerk of the India
House, and so his thought burgeons&mdash;by very necessity&mdash;into
that kindred leafage of phrase which
lifts and sways in the gentle breezes of his always
gentle purpose.</p>

<p>Another name, of a man far less lovable, but perhaps
more widely known, is that of Sir William
Temple.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> He was of excellent family, born in London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
highly cultivated, and lived all through the
reign of Charles II., and much beyond. He represented
England, in diplomatic ways, often upon
the Continent, and with great success; he negotiated
the so-called Triple Alliance; he also brought
about that royal marriage of the daughter of the
Duke of York (afterward James II.), with William of
Orange, and so gave to England that royal couple,
William and Mary. He had great dignity; he had
wealth; a sort of earlier Edward Everett&mdash;as polished
and cold and well-meaning and fastidious;
looking rather more to the elegance of his speech
than to the burden of it; always making show of
Classicism&mdash;nothing if not correct; cautious;
keeping well out of harm’s way, and all pugnacious
expressions of opinion; courteous to strong
Churchmen; courteous to Papists; bowing low to
my Lady Castelmaine; very considerate of Cromwellians
who had power; moulding his habit and
speech so as to show no ugly angles of opinion
anywhere, but only such convenient roundness as
would roll along life’s level easily to the very end.
You will not be in the way of encountering much
that he wrote, though he had the reputation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
those days, and long after, of writing excellently
well. “He was the first writer,” said Johnson,
“who gave cadence to English prose.”</p>

<p>Among his essays is one on “Ancient and Modern
Learning,” showing the pretensions of a scholastic
man, whose assumptions brought about a
controversy into which Richard Bentley, a rare
young critic, entered, and out of which grew eventually
Swift’s famous <cite>Battle of the Books</cite>.</p>

<p>Temple also wrote on gardens, with a safer swing
for his learning and his taste; traces of what his
taste was in such matters are still discernible about
his old home of Moor Park, in Surrey. It lies some
forty miles from London, on the way to Southampton
and the Isle of Wight, near the old town of
Farnham, where there is a venerable bishop’s palace
worth the seeing; a mile away one may find the
terraces of Sir William’s old garden, and the mossy
dial under which he ordered his heart to be buried.
Another interest, moreover, attaches to these Moor
Park gardens, which will make them doubly worth
a visit. On their terraces and under their trees
used to pace and meditate that strange creature
Jonathan Swift, who was in his young days a <i lang="fr">protégé</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
or secretary of Sir William Temple; and there,
too, in the same shade, and along the same terraces,
used to stroll and meditate in different mood, poor
Mistress Hester Johnson, the “Stella” of Swift’s
life-long love-dream.</p>

<p>We shall meet these people again. But I leave
Sir William Temple, commending to your attention
a delightful little essay of Charles Lamb, in
his volume of Elia, upon “The Genteel Style in
Writing.” It gives a fair though flattering notion
of the ways of Sir William’s life, and of the way of
his work.</p>

<h3>John Dryden.</h3>

<p>Of course we know John Dryden’s name a great
deal better than we know Sir William Temple’s;
better, perhaps, than we know any other name of
that period. And yet do we know his poems
well? Are there any that you specially cherish
and doat upon? any that kindle your sympathies
easily into blaze? any that give electric expression
to your own poetic yearnings, and put you upon
quick and enchanting drift into that empyrean of
song whereto the great poets decoy us? I doubt if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
there is much of Dryden which has this subtle influence
upon you; certainly it has not upon me.</p>

<p>There are the great Cecilia odes, which hold their
places in the reading-books, with their</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Double&mdash;double&mdash;double beat</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of the thundering drum;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the royal</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">“Philip’s warlike son,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Aloft in awful state;</div>
<div class="verse">The lovely Thais by his side,</div>
<div class="verse">&mdash;Like a blooming Eastern bride</div>
<div class="verse">In flower of youth and beauty’s pride;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">all which we read over and over, always with an
ambitious vocalism which the language invites, but,
I think, with not much hearty unction.</p>

<p>And yet, notwithstanding the little that we recall
of this man’s work, he did write an enormous
amount of verse, in all metres, and of all lengths.
All the poems that Milton ever published would
hardly fill the space necessary for a full synopsis of
what John Dryden wrote. But let us begin at the
beginning.</p>

<p>This poet, and important man of letters, was born
only a year or two later than John Bunyan, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the same range of country&mdash;a little to the northward,
in an old rectory of Aldwinckle (Northamptonshire),
upon the banks of the river Nen. And
this river flows thence northerly, in great loops,
where sedges grow, past the tall spire of Oundle&mdash;past
the grassy ruins of Fotheringay; and thence
easterly, in other great loops, through flat lands, under
the huge towers of Peterborough Cathedral.
But the river singing among the sedges does not
come into Dryden’s verse; nor does Fotheringay,
with its tragic memories; nor do the noble woods of
Lilford Park, or of that Rockingham Forest which,
in the days of Dryden’s boyhood, must in many
places have brought its spurs of oak timber and its
haunts of the red-deer close down to the Nen banks.
Indeed, Wordsworth says, with a little exaggeration,
it is true, “there is not a single image from nature
in the whole body of his [Dryden’s] works.”</p>

<p>He was a well-born boy, with titled kinsfolk, and
had money at command for good courses in books.
He was at Westminster School under Dr. Busby;
was at Cambridge, where he fell one time into difficulties,
which somehow angered him in a way that
made him somewhat irreverent of his old college in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
after life. There are pretty traditions that in extreme
youth he addressed some very earnest amatory
verses to a certain Helen Driden, daughter of
his baronet uncle at Canons-Ashby;<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and there are
hints dropped by some biographers of a rebuff to
him; which, if it came about, did not pluck away
the cheerfulness and self-approval that lay in him.
It was in London, however, where he went after
his father’s death, and when he was twenty-seven,
that the first verse was written by him which made
the literary world prick up its ears at sound of a
new voice.</p>

<p>’Tis in eulogy of Cromwell, dying just then, and
this is a bit of it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Swift and resistless thro’ the land he past,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Like that bold Greek, who did the East subdue,</div>
<div class="verse">And made to battles such heroic haste,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">As if on wings of Victory he flew.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“He fought, secure of fortune as of fame:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Still by new maps the island might be shown,</div>
<div class="verse">Of conquests, which he strew’d where-e’er he came,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Thick as the galaxy with stars is strown.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“His ashes in a peaceful urn shall rest,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">His name, a great example stands, to show</div>
<div class="verse">How strangely high endeavors may be blest,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Where piety and valor jointly go.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A short two years after, you will remember, and
Charles II. came to his own and was crowned; and
how does this eulogist of Cromwell treat his coronation?
In a way that is worth our listening to; for,
I think, a comparison of the Cromwellian verses
with the Carolan eulogy gives us a key to John Dryden’s
character:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“All eyes you draw, and with the eyes, the heart:</div>
<div class="verse">Of your own pomp yourself the greatest part:</div>
<div class="verse">Next to the sacred temple you are led,</div>
<div class="verse">Where waits a crown for your more sacred head:</div>
<div class="verse">The grateful choir their harmony employ,</div>
<div class="verse">Not to make greater, but more solemn joy.</div>
<div class="verse">Wrapt soft and warm your name is sent on high,</div>
<div class="verse">As flames do on the waves of incense fly:</div>
<div class="verse">Music herself is lost, in vain she brings</div>
<div class="verse">Her choicest notes to praise the best of kings;</div>
<div class="verse">Her melting strains in you a tomb have found,</div>
<div class="verse">And lie like bees in their own sweetness drown’d.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No wonder that he came ultimately to have the
place of Poet-laureate, and thereafter an extra £100
a year with it! No wonder that, with all his cleverness&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
it was prodigious&mdash;he never did, and
never could, win an unsullied reputation for sterling
integrity and straightforward purpose.</p>

<p>I know that his latest biographer and advocate,
Mr. Saintsbury, whose work you will be very apt to
encounter in the little series edited by John Morley,
sees poems like those I have cited with other eyes,
and fashions out of them an agreeable poetic consistency
very honorable to Dryden; but I cannot
twist myself so as to view the matter in his way. I
think rather of a conscienceless thrifty newspaper,
setting forth the average every-day drift of opinion,
with a good deal more than every-day skill.</p>

<p>Meantime John Dryden has married, and has
married the daughter of an earl; of just how this
came about we have not very full record; but there
were a great many who wondered why she should
marry him; and a good many more, as it appeared,
who persisted in wondering why he should marry
her. Such wonderments of wondering people overtake
a good many matches. It is quite certain that
it was not a marriage which went to make a domestic
man of him; and I think you will search vainly
through his poems for any indication of those home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
instincts which, like the “melting strains” he flung
about King Charles,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Lie like bees in their own sweetness drown’d.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The only positive worldly good which seemed to
come of this marriage was an occasional home at
Charlton, in Wiltshire&mdash;an estate of the Earl of
Berkshire, his father-in-law&mdash;where Dryden wrote,
shortly after his marriage, his <cite>Annus Mirabilis</cite>,
in which he gave to all the notable events of the
year 1666 a fillip with his pen; and the odd conceits
that lie in a single one of his stanzas keep
yet alive a story of the capture by the British of a
fleet of Dutch India ships:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Amidst whole heaps of spices lights a ball,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And now their odors armed against them fly;</div>
<div class="verse">Some preciously by shattered porcelain fall,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And some by aromatic splinters die.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are three hundred other stanzas in the
poem, of the same make and rhythm, telling of fire,
of plague, and of battles. I am not sure if anybody
reads it nowadays; but if you do&mdash;and it is not
fatiguing&mdash;you will find wonderful word-craft in it,
which repeats the din and crash of battle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
paints the smouldering rage and the blazing power
of the Great Fire of London in a way which certain
boys, I well remember in old school days, thought
represented the grand climacteric of poetic diction.</p>

<h3>The London of Dryden.</h3>

<p>But let us not forget where we are in our English
story; it is London that has been all aflame in that
dreadful year of 1666. Thirteen thousand houses
have been destroyed, eighty odd churches, and
some four hundred acres of ground in the central
part of the city have been burned over. The fire
had followed swiftly upon the devastating plague of
the previous year, which Dryden had gone into
Wiltshire to avoid. It is doubtful, indeed, if he
came back soon enough to see the great blaze with
his own eyes; “chemical fire,” the poet calls it, and
it licked up the poison of the plague; but it did not
lick up the leprosy of Charles’ court. There was a
demand for plays, and for plays of a bad sort; and
Dryden met the demand. Never was there an author
more apt to divine what the public did want,
and more full of literary contrivances to meet it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Dryden knew all the purveyors of this sort of intellectual
repast, and all their methods, and soon became
a king among them; and to be a king among
the playwrights was to have a very large sovereignty
in that time. Everybody talked of the plays; all
of Royalist faith went to the plays, if they had
money; and money was becoming more and more
plentiful. There had been the set-back, it is true,
of the Great Fire; but English commerce was making
enormous strides in these days. There was a
pathetic folding of the hands and dreary forecastings
directly after the disaster, as after all such
calamities. But straight upon this the city grew,
with wider streets and taller houses, and in only a
very few years the waste ground was covered again,
and the new temple of St. Paul’s rising, under the
guidance of Sir Christopher Wren, into those grand
proportions of cupola and dome, which, in their
smoked and sooty majesty, dominate the city of
London to-day.</p>

<p>Houses of nobles and of rich merchants which
stood near to Cornhill and Lombard Street, and
private gardens which had occupied areas thereabout&mdash;now
representing millions of pounds in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
value&mdash;were crowded away westward by the new
demands of commerce. In Dryden’s day there
were ducal houses looking upon Lincoln’s Inn
Fields; and others, with pleasure grounds about
them, close upon Covent Garden Square. Americans
go to that neighborhood now, in early morning,
to catch sight of the immense stores of fruit
and vegetables which are on show there upon
market-days; and they are well repaid for such
visit; yet the houses are dingy, and a welter of
straw and mud and market <i lang="fr">débris</i> stretches to the
doors; but the stranger, picking his way through
this, and through Russell Street to the corner of
Bow Street, will find, close by, the site of that
famous Will’s Coffee-house, where Dryden lorded it
so many years, and whose figure there&mdash;in the
chimney-corner, with his pipe, laying down the law
between the whiffs, and conferring honors by offering
a pinch from his snuff-box&mdash;Scott has made
familiar to the whole world.</p>

<p>It was an earlier sort of club-house, where the
news in the <cite>Gazette</cite> was talked of, and the last battle&mdash;if
there were a recent one&mdash;and the last play,
and the last scandal of the court. Its discussions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and potations made away with a good many nights,
and a good many pipes and bottles, and was not
largely provocative of domesticity. But it does not
appear that the Lady Elizabeth&mdash;Dryden’s wife&mdash;ever
made remonstrances on this score; indeed, Mr.
Green, the historian, would intimate that my lady
had distractions of her own, not altogether wise or
worthy; but we prefer to believe the best we can of
her.</p>

<p>To this gathering-place at Covent Garden Etherege
and Wycherley found their way&mdash;all writing
men, in fact; even the great Buckingham perhaps&mdash;before
his quarrel; and Dorset, fellow-member
with Dryden, of the Royal Society; maybe Butler
too, when he found himself in London; and
poor Otway,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> hoping to meet some one generous
enough to pay his score for him; and the young
Congreve, proud in his earlier days to get a nod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
from the great Dryden; and, prouder yet, when,
at a later time, he was honored by that tender and
pathetic epistle from the Laureate:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Already I am worn with cares and age,</div>
<div class="verse">And just abandoning the ungrateful stage;</div>
<div class="verse">But you, whom every muse and grace adorn,</div>
<div class="verse">Whom I foresee to better fortune born,</div>
<div class="verse">Be kind to my remains; and O defend,</div>
<div class="verse">Against your judgment, your departed friend!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I said that he wrote plays; wrote them by the
couple&mdash;by the dozen&mdash;by the score possibly.</p>

<p>You do not know them; and I hope you never
will know them to love them. They have fallen
away from literature&mdash;never acted, and rarely read.
He could not plot a story, and he had not the dramatic
gift. One wonders how a theatreful could
have listened to their pomposity and inflation and
exaggerations. But they did, and they filled Dryden’s
pockets. There were scenic splendors, indeed,
about many of them which delighted the pit,
and which the poet loved as accompaniments to
the roll of his sonorous verse; there were, too,
fragments here and there, with epithet and characterization
that showed his mastership; and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the most graceful of lyrics budded out from
the coarse groundwork of the play, as fair in sound
as they were foul in thought.</p>

<p>In private intercourse Dryden is represented to
have been a man of courteous speech, never low
and ribald&mdash;as were many of the royal favorites;
and when he undertook playwriting to order, to
meet the profligate tastes of the court, he could
not, like some lesser playwrights, disguise double-meanings
and vulgarities under a flimsy veil of
courtliness; but by his very sincerity he made all
his lewdness rank, and all his indelicacies brutal.
This will, and should, I think, keep his plays
away from our reading-desks.</p>

<p>Dryden’s satires, written later, show a better
and far stronger side of his literary quality; and
Buckingham, long after his lineaments shall have
faded from a mob of histories, will stand preserved
as Zimri, in the strong pickle of Dryden’s verse;
you will have met the picture, perhaps without
knowing it, for the magnificent courtier, who wrote
“The Rehearsal:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A man so various that he seemed to be</div>
<div class="verse">Not one, but all mankind’s epitome:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong;</div>
<div class="verse">Was everything by starts, and nothing long,</div>
<div class="verse">But in the course of one revolving moon</div>
<div class="verse">Was chymist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon;</div>
<div class="verse">Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking,</div>
<div class="verse">Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A man who writes in that way about a peer of
England was liable to write of lesser men in a
manner that would stir hot blood; and he did.
Once upon a time this great king at “Will’s”
was waylaid and sorrily cudgelled; which is an
experience that&mdash;however it may come about&mdash;is
not elevating in its effects, nor does it increase our
sense of a man’s dignity; for it is an almost universal
fact that the men most worthy of respect, in
almost any society, are the men who never do get
quietly cudgelled.</p>

<h3>Later Poems and Purpose.</h3>

<p>Far on in 1682, when our Dryden was waxing
oldish, and when he had given over play-going for
somewhat more of church-going, he wrote, in the
same verse with his satires, and with the same ringing
couplets of sound, a defence of the moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
liberal churchmanship that does not yield to ecclesiastic
fetters, and that thinks widely. A little later,
in 1687, he writes in a more assured vein, assuming
bold defence of Romanism&mdash;as it existed in that
day in England&mdash;to which faith he had become a
convert. This last is a curiously designed poem,
showing how little he had the arts of construction
in hand; it is a long argument between a Hind and
a Panther, in the shades of a forest. Was ever
ecclesiasticism so recommended before? Yet there
are brave and unforgetable lines in it: instance the
noble rhythm, and the noble burden of that passage
beginning&mdash;like a trumpet note&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What weight of ancient witness can prevail,</div>
<div class="verse">If private reason hold the public scale?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again the fine tribute to “the Church:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Thus one, thus pure, behold her largely spread,</div>
<div class="verse">Like the fair ocean from her mother bed;</div>
<div class="verse">From East to West triumphantly she rides;</div>
<div class="verse">All shores are watered by her wealthy tides;</div>
<div class="verse">The Gospel-sound, diffused from pole to pole</div>
<div class="verse">Where winds can carry, and where waves can roll;</div>
<div class="verse">The self-same doctrine of the sacred page</div>
<div class="verse">Conveyed to every clime, in every age.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>I think Bishop Heber had a reverent and a
stealthy look upon these lines when he wrote a certain
stanza of his “Greenland’s icy mountains.”</p>

<p>The enemies of Dryden did not fail to observe
that between the dates of the two professions of
faith named, Charles II. had died, summoning
a Papist priest, at the very last, to give him a
chance&mdash;and, it is feared, a small one&mdash;of reconcilement
with Heaven; furthermore, these enemies
remembered that the bigot James II. had come to
the throne, full of Papist zeal and of a poor hope to
bring all England to a great somerset of faith. Did
Dryden undergo an innocent change? Maybe;
may not be. Certainly neither Lord Macaulay, nor
Elkanah Settle, nor Saintsbury, nor you, nor I, have
the right to go behind the veil of privacy which in
such matters is every man’s privilege.</p>

<p>How odd it seems that this Papist convert of
James II.’s time, and author of so many plays that
outranked Etherege in rankness, should have put
the <cite>Veni, Creator</cite>, of Charlemagne (if it be his) into
such reverent and trenchant English as carries it
into so many of our hymnals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Creator Spirit, by whose aid</div>
<div class="verse">The world’s foundations first were laid,</div>
<div class="verse">Come, visit every humble mind;</div>
<div class="verse">Come, pour thy joys on humankind;</div>
<div class="verse">From sin and sorrow set us free,</div>
<div class="verse">And make thy temples worthy thee.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nor was this all of Dryden’s translating work.
He roamed high and low among all the treasures of
the ancients. Theocritus gave his tangle of sweet
sounds to him, and Homer his hexameters; Juvenal
and Horace and Ovid were turned into his
verse; and Dryden’s <cite>Virgil</cite> is the only Virgil of
thousands of readers. He sought motive, too, in
Boccaccio and Chaucer; and within times the oldest
of us can remember his “Flower and Leaf” and
his “Palamon and Arcite” were more read and
known than the poems of like name attributed to
Chaucer. But in the newer and more popular renderings
and printings of the old English poet,
Chaucer has come to his own again, and rings out
his tales with a lark-like melody that outgoes in
richness and charm all the happy paraphrases of
Dryden.</p>

<p>A still more dangerous task our poet undertook
in the days of his dramatic work. I have in my library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
some half dozen of Dryden’s plays&mdash;yellowed
and tattered, and of the imprint of 1710 or thereabout&mdash;and
among them is one bearing this title,
<cite>The Tempest, originally written by William Shakespeare,
and altered and improved by John Dryden</cite>;
and the story of Antony and Cleopatra underwent
the same sort of improvement&mdash;dangerous work for
Dryden; dangerous for any of us. And yet this
latter, under name of “All for Love,” was one of
Dryden’s greatest successes, and reckoned by many
dramatic critics of that day far superior to Shakespeare.</p>

<p>One more extract from this voluminous poet and
we shall leave him; it was written when he was
well toward sixty, and when his dramatic experiences
were virtually ended; it is from an ode in
memory of Mistress Killigrew, a friend and a poetess.
In the course of it he makes honest bewailment,
into which it would seem his whole heart entered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O gracious God! how far have we</div>
<div class="verse">Profaned thy heavenly gift of Poesy?</div>
<div class="verse">Made prostitute and profligate the muse,</div>
<div class="verse">Debased to each obscene and impious use,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose harmony was first ordained above</div>
<div class="verse">For tongues of angels, and for hymns of love?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p>And again, a verselet that is full of all his most
characteristic manner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When in mid-air the golden trump shall sound,</div>
<div class="verse">To raise the nations under ground;</div>
<div class="verse">When in the Valley of Jehoshaphat,</div>
<div class="verse">The judging God shall close the book of Fate;</div>
<div class="verse">And there the last assizes keep,</div>
<div class="verse">For those who wake and those who sleep:</div>
<div class="verse">When rattling bones together fly,</div>
<div class="verse">From the four corners of the sky;</div>
<div class="verse">When sinews o’er the skeletons are spread,</div>
<div class="verse">Those clothed with flesh, and life inspires the dead;</div>
<div class="verse">The sacred poets first shall hear the sound,</div>
<div class="verse">And foremost from the tomb shall bound,</div>
<div class="verse">For they are covered with the lightest ground;</div>
<div class="verse">And straight, with inborn vigor, on the wing,</div>
<div class="verse">Like mounting larks, to the new morning sing.</div>
<div class="verse">Then thou, sweet Saint, before the quire shall go,</div>
<div class="verse">As Harbinger of Heaven, the way to show,</div>
<div class="verse">The way which thou so well hast learnt below!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have given much space to our talk about
Dryden. Is it because we like him so well? By no
means. It is because he was the greatest master
among the literary craftsmen of his day; it is because
he wrought in so many and various forms,
and always with a steady, unflinching capacity for
toil, which knew no shake or pause; it is because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
he had a marvellously keen sense for all the symphonies
of heroic language, and could always cheat
and charm the ear with his reverberant thunders;
it is because he spanned a great interval of English
letters, covering it with various accomplishment;
criticising keenly, and accepted as a critic; judging
fairly, and accepted as a judge in the great court of
language; teaching, by his example, of uses and
fashions of use, which were heeded by his contemporaries,
and which put younger men upon the
track of better and worthier achievement.</p>

<p>Again, it is because he, more than any other of
his epoch, represented in himself and in what he
wrought, the drift and bent and actualities of the
time. There were changes of dynasties, and he put
into language, for all England, the lamentation
over the old and the glorification of the new;
there were plagues and conflagrations and upbuildings
of desolated cities&mdash;and the fumes and the
flames and the din of all these get speech of him,
and such color as put them in undying record upon
the roll of history; there were changes of faith,
and vague out-reaches for some sure ground of religious
establishment&mdash;and his poems tell of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
struggle, and in his own personality represent the
stress of a whole nation’s doubts; there are
battles raging round the coasts&mdash;and the echo of
them, in some shape of trumpet blare or shrill
military resonance, seems never to go out of his
poems; dissoluteness rules in the court and in
the city, infecting all&mdash;and Dryden wallows with
them through a score of his uncanny dramas.</p>

<p>Put his poems together in the order of their
composition, and without any other historic data
whatever, they would show the changes and quavers
and sudden enthusiasms and bestialities and doubts
and growth of the National Life. But they would
most rarely show the noble impulses that kindle
hope and foretoken better things to come&mdash;rarely
the elevating purpose that commands our reverence.</p>

<p>No fictitious character of his is a live one to-day;
you can hardly recall one if you try.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> No couplet
or verselet of his is so freighted with a serene or
hopeful philosophy as to make our march the
blither by reason of it down the corridors of time.
No blast of all his fanfaron of trumpets sounds the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
opening of the gates upon any Delectable Mountains.
A great, clever, literary worker! I think
that is all we can say of him. And when you or I
pass under his monument in the corner of Westminster
Abbey, we will stand bowed respectfully,
but not with any such veneration, I think, as we
expect to carry to the tomb of Milton or of
Chaucer; and if one falls on Pope&mdash;what then?
I think we might pause&mdash;waver; more polish here&mdash;more
power there&mdash;the humanities not radiant
in either; and so we might safely sidle away to
warm ourselves before the cenotaph of Goldsmith.</p>

<h3>John Locke.</h3>

<p>Another man who grew up in these times in England,
and who from his study-window at Oxford
(where he had been Lecturer on Rhetoric) saw the
Great Fire of London in the shape of a vast, yellow,
sulphurous-looking cloud, of portentous aspect, rolling
toward the zenith, and covering half the sky,
was Mr. John Locke.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>We are too apt, I think, to dismiss this author
from our thoughts as a man full only of dreary
metaphysic subtleties; and support the belief with
the story that our Jonathan Edwards read his
treatise on the <cite>Human Understanding</cite> with great delight
at the age of fourteen. Yet Locke, although
a man of the keenest and rarest intellect&mdash;which
almost etherialized his looks&mdash;was possessed of a
wonderful deal of what he would have called “hard,
round-about sense;” indeed it would be quite possible
to fill a whole calendar with bits of his printed
talk that would be as pitpat and common-sensical
as anything in <cite>Poor Richard’s Almanac</cite>. Moreover,
he could, on occasions, tell a neat and droll story,
which would set the “table in a roar.”</p>

<p>Some facts in the life of this great thinker and
writer are worth our remembering, not only by
reason of the fame of his books, but because in
all those years whose turbulent rush and corrupting
influences have shown themselves in our pages,
John Locke lived an upright, manly, self-respecting
life, though brought into intimate relations with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
many most prominent at court. He was born in
Western England, north of the Mendip Hills; and
after fourteen years of quiet country life, and kind
parental training, among the orchard slopes of
Somersetshire, went to Westminster School; was
many years thereafter at Oxford; studied medicine;
met Lord Ashley (afterward the great Shaftesbury&mdash;first
party-leader in English parliamentary
history), who was so taken by the pale, intellectual
face of the young Doctor that he carried him off to
London, and domiciled him in his great house upon
the Strand. There Locke directed the studies of
Ashley’s son; and presently&mdash;such was my Lord’s
confidence in him&mdash;was solicited to find a wife for
the young gentleman;<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> which he did, to the great
acceptance of all parties, by taking him off into
Rutlandshire, and introducing him to a pretty
daughter of the Earl of Rutland. Fancy the author
of an <cite>Essay Concerning the Human Understanding</cite>
setting off in a coach, with six long-tailed Flemish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
horses, for a four days’ journey into the north of
England&mdash;with a young scion of the Ashleys&mdash;upon
such an errand as that! Our doctors in metaphysics
do not, I believe, engage in similar service;
yet I suppose nice observation would disclose
great and curious mental activities in the evolution
of such schemes.</p>

<p>The philosopher must have known Dryden,
both being early members of the Royal Society;
but I have a fancy that Locke was a man who did
not&mdash;save on rarest occasions&mdash;take a pipe and a
mug at such a place as Will’s Coffee-house. His
tastes led him more to banquets at Exeter House.
There was foreign travel, also, in which he accomplished
himself in continental languages and socialities;
he had offers of diplomatic preferment, but
his doubtful health (always making him what over-well
people call a fussy man) forbade acceptance;
else we might have had in him another Sir William
Temple. Shaftesbury interested him in his
scheme of new planting the Carolina colony in
America; and John Locke drew up rules for its political
guidance. Some of these sound very drolly
now. Thus&mdash;no man was to be a freeman of Carolina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
unless he acknowledged a God, and agreed
that he was to be publicly and solemnly worshipped.
The members of one church were not to
molest or persecute those of another. Again, “no
one shall be permitted to plead before a court of
justice for money or reward.” What a howling desert
this would make of most of our courts!</p>

<p>Again, he writes with great zest upon the subject
of Education, and almost with the warmth of that
old Roger Ascham, whose maxims I cited in one of
our earlier talks:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Till you can find a school wherein it is possible for the
master to look after the manners of his scholars, and can
show as great effects of his care of forming their minds to
virtue, and their carriage to good breeding, as of forming
their tongues to the learned languages, you must confess
that you have a strange value for words, to hazard your sons’
innocence and virtue for a little Greek and Latin.”</p>

</div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I know not why anyone should waste his time and beat
his head about the Latin grammar, who does not intend to
be a critic, or make speeches, and write despatches in it. If
his use of it be only to understand some books writ in it
without a critical knowledge of the tongue itself, reading
alone will attain his end, without charging his mind with
the multiplied rules and intricacies of grammar.”…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“If there may be any reasons against children’s making
Latin themes at school, I have much more to say and of more
weight against their making verses&mdash;verses of any sort. For
if he has no genius to poetry, ’tis the most unreasonable
thing in the world to torment a child and waste his time
about that which can never succeed: and if he have a poetic
vein&mdash;methinks the parents should labor to have it stifled:
for if he proves a successful rhymer, and get once the reputation
of a wit, I desire it may be considered what company
and places he is likely to spend his time in&mdash;nay, and his
estate too.”</p>

</div>

<p>By which I am more than ever convinced that
Locke did not sup often with Dryden at “Will’s,”
and that you will find no pleasant verselets&mdash;look
as hard as you may&mdash;on a single page of his discourse
on the <cite>Human Understanding</cite>.</p>

<p>When Charles grew suspicious of Shaftesbury,
and the Earl was shorn of his power, no little of the
odium fell upon his <i lang="fr">protégé</i>; and for a time there
was an enforced&mdash;or at least a very prudent&mdash;exile
for Locke, at one time in France and at another
in Holland. It was on these absences that his pen
was busiest. In 1689 he returned to England in
the trail of William III.; came to new honors under
that monarch; published his great work, which
had been simmering in his brain for ten years or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
more; made a great fame at home and abroad, and
wrote wisely on many topics. Meanwhile his old
enemy, the asthma, was afflicting him sorely. London
smoke was a torture to him; but when he went
only so little distance away (twenty miles northward)
as the country home of his friends Sir Francis
and Lady Masham, a delightful calm came to
him. He was given his own apartment there;
never did hosts more enjoy a guest; and never a
guest enjoyed more the immunities and kindnesses
which Sir Francis and Lady bestowed upon him.
Twelve or fourteen years of idyllic life for the philosopher
followed, in the wooded alleys and upon
the charming lawns of the old manor-house of
Oates, in the county of Essex; there were leisurely,
coy journeys to London; there were welcoming
visits from old friends; there was music indoors,
and music&mdash;of the birds&mdash;without. Bachelors
rarely come to those quietudes and joys of a home-life
which befell the old age of Locke, and equipped
all his latter days with such serenities as were a
foretaste of heaven.</p>

<p>He does not lie in Westminster Abbey: I think
he would have rebelled among the poets: he sleeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
more quietly in the pretty church-yard of High-Lavor,
a little way off, northward, from the New
Park of Epping Forest.</p>

<h3>End of the King and Others.</h3>

<p>The lives of these two men&mdash;Dryden and Locke&mdash;have
brought us past the whole reach of Charles
II.’s reign. That ignoble monarch has met his fate
courageously; some days before the immediate end
he knew it was coming, and had kind words for
those about him.</p>

<p>He died on a Friday,<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and on the Sunday before
had held great revel in the famous gallery of Whitehall;
next day came the warnings, and then the
blow&mdash;paralytic, or other such&mdash;which shrivelled
his showy powers, and brought his swarthy face to
a whiteness and a death-like pallor that shocked
those gay people who belonged in the palace.
Then came the scourging with hot iron, and the
administration of I know not what foul drugs that
belonged to the blind medication of that day&mdash;all
in vain; there were suspicions of poison; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
poison he died of was of his own making, and he
had been taking it ever since boyhood.</p>

<p>A Catholic priest came to him stealthily and
made the last promises to him he was ever to hear.
To a courtier, who came again and again, he apologized&mdash;showing
his courtesy to the last. “I’m an
awful time in dying,” he said; and to somebody
else&mdash;his brother, perhaps&mdash;“don’t let poor Nell
Gwynne starve;” and so died.</p>

<p>James, the successor, was not loved&mdash;scarce by
anyone; bigoted, obstinate, selfish, he ran quickly
through the short race of which the histories will
tell you. Only three years of it, or thereabout, and
then&mdash;<em>presto!</em> like the changing of the scenes at
Drury Lane Theatre in one of the splendid spectacles
of the day&mdash;James scuds away, and Cousin
William (with his wife Mary, both of the blood
royal of England) comes in, and sets up a fashion of
rule, and an assured Protestant succession of regal
names which is not ended yet.</p>

<p>And now, in closing this talk, I will summon into
presence once again some of the notable personages
who have given intellectual flavor to the years we
have gone over, and will call the roll of a few new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
names among those actors who are to take in swift
succession the places of those who disappear. At
the date where we now are&mdash;1688&mdash;the date of
the last English Revolution (who, pray, can predict
the next?), the date of John Bunyan’s death,
the date of Alexander Pope’s birth&mdash;excellent remembrancers,
these!&mdash;at this epoch, I say, of the
incoming of William and Mary, all those dramatic
writers&mdash;of whom we made mention as having put
a little tangled fringe of splendor about the great
broidery of Shakespeare’s work&mdash;were gone. So
was Herrick, with his sweet poems, and his pigs
and tankards; and Howell, and Wotton, and the
saintly George Herbert, and dear, good, old Izaak
Walton&mdash;all comfortably dead and buried. So
were Andrew Marvell, and the author of <cite>Hudibras</cite>.
Archbishop Laud was gone long since to the scaffold,
with the fullest acquiescence of all New Englanders;
Jeremy Taylor gone&mdash;if ever man had
right of way there&mdash;to heaven; Milton dead;
Cowley dead; Waller dead.</p>

<p>Old, ear-cropped Prynne, of the <cite>Histriomastix</cite>,
was still living&mdash;close upon seventy&mdash;grim and
gray, and as pugnacious as a bull-terrier. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
others lingering upon the downhill side of life
were Robert Boyle and that John Evelyn, whose
love of the fields and gardens and trees had put
long life in his blood and brain. Sir William
Temple, too, had still some years of elegant distinction
to coquet with; our old friend of the Pepysian
journal was yet alert&mdash;his political ambitions active,
his eye-sight failing&mdash;never thinking, we may
be sure, that his pot-luck of a <cite>Diary</cite> would keep
him more savory with us to-day than all his wigs
and his coaches, and his fine acquaintance, and his
great store of bric-à-brac.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton was not fifty yet, but had somehow
lost that elasticity and searchingness of brain which
had untwisted the sunbeams, and solved the riddle
of gravitation. Bishop Burnet, and that William
Penn whose name ought to hold place on any American
file of England’s worthies, were in the full
vigor of middle age. Daniel De Foe was some
eight and twenty, and known only as a sharp
trader, who had written a few pamphlets, and who
was enrolled in those soldier ranks which went to
greet William III. on his arrival at Torbay.</p>

<p>Matthew Prior was still younger, and had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
no show of those graces and that art which gave
him later an ambassador’s place, and a tomb and
monument in the “Poet’s Corner” of the Abbey.
Jonathan Swift, then scarce twenty-one, is unheard
of as yet, and is nursing quietly the power
and the bitterness with which, through two succeeding
reigns, he is to write and rave and rage.</p>

<p>Still more youthful are those two promising lads,
Addison and Steele, listening with their sharp
young ears to the fine verses of Mr. Dryden, and
watching and waiting for the day when they, too,
shall say somewhat to be of record for ages after
them. And so, with these bright young fellows at
the front, and the excellent gray-heads I have
named at the rear, we ring down the curtain upon
our present entertainment with an “<i lang="la">Exeunt omnes!</i>”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">I have a fear that my readers were not overmuch
interested in what I had to say of that
witty Dr. Thomas Fuller who wrote about the
<cite>Worthies of England</cite>, and who pressed his stalwart
figure (for he was of the bigness of our own Phillips
Brooks&mdash;corporeal and mental) through many a
London crowd that came to his preachments. Yet
his worthiness is something larger than that which
comes from his story of the <cite>Worthies</cite>.</p>

<p>Sir William Temple, too, is a name that can
hardly have provoked much enthusiasm, unless
among those who love gardens, and who recall
with rural unction his horticultural experiences at
Sheen, and at Moor Park in Surrey. But that
kindly, handsome, meditative, eccentric doctor of
Norwich&mdash;Sir Thomas Browne&mdash;was of a different
and more lovable quality, the memory of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
I hope may find lodgement in the reader’s heart.
His <cite>Religio Medici</cite>, if not his <cite>Hydriotaphia</cite>, should
surely find place in every well-appointed library.</p>

<p>As for John Dryden&mdash;do what you like with his
books; but do not forget that he left behind him
writings that show all the colors and reflect all the
follies and faiths of the days in which he lived&mdash;plays
with a portentous pomp of language&mdash;lyrics
that were most melodious and most unsavory&mdash;satire
that flashed and cut like a sword, and odes
that had the roll and swell of martial music in
them.</p>

<p>John Locke if less known, was worthier; and
we have reason, which I tried to show, for thinking
of him as a pure-hearted, level-headed, high-minded
man&mdash;an abiding honor to his race.</p>

<h3>Kings Charles, James, and William.</h3>

<p>It may help the reader to keep in memory the sequence
of these English sovereigns if I tell him
somewhat of their relationship. James II.&mdash;previously
and longer known as that Duke of York, in
honor of whom our metropolitan city (in those days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
conquered from the Dutch) was called New York&mdash;we
know as only brother to Charles II., who
died without legitimate children. This James was
as bigoted and obstinate as Charles was profligate
and suave. We think of him as having lost his
throne in that revolution of 1688, by reason of his
popish tendencies; but it is doubtful if Protestantism
would have saved him, or made a better man of
him. He had married&mdash;and it was a marriage he
tried hard to abjure and escape from&mdash;a daughter
of that Earl of Clarendon whose <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>
I named to you. There were two daughters
by this marriage, Mary and Anne; both of them,
through the influence of their Clarendon grandfather,
brought up as Protestants. The elder of
these, Mary, was a fine woman, tall, dignified,
graceful, cultivated&mdash;as times went&mdash;whose greatest
foible was a love for cards, at which she played
for heavy stakes, and&mdash;often. Her sister Anne
shared the same foible, and gave it cherishment all
her life; but was not reckoned the equal of her
elder sister; had none of her grace; was short,
dumpy, overfond of good dinners, and with such
limited culture as made her notelets (even when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
she came to be Queen) full of blunders that would
put a school-mistress of our day into spasms. We
shall meet her, and more pleasantly, again.</p>

<p>But Mary&mdash;heir next after James to the throne&mdash;had
married William of Orange, who was a fighting
Dutch general; keen, cool, selfish, brave, calculating,
with an excellent head for business; cruel at
times, unscrupulous, too, but a good Protestant.
He was great-grandson to that famous William the
Silent, whose story everyone has read, or should
read, in the pages of Motley.</p>

<p>But how came he, a Dutchman, and speaking
English brokenly, to share the British throne with
Mary? There were two very excellent reasons:
First, he was own cousin to Mary, his mother having
been a daughter of Charles I.; and next, he had
kingly notions of husbandship, and refused to go
to England on any throne-seeking errand, which
might involve hard fighting, without sharing to
the full the sovereignty of his wife Mary.</p>

<p>So he did go as conqueror and king; there being
most easy march to London; the political scene
changing like the turn of a kaleidoscope; but there
came fighting in Ireland, as at Londonderry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the battle of the Boyne; and a brooding unrest in
Scotland, of which, whenever you come to read or
study, you should mate your reading with that
charming story of <cite>Old Mortality</cite>&mdash;one of the
best of Scott’s. Its scene reaches over from the
days of Charles II. to the early years of the Dutch
King William, and sets before one more vividly
than any history all those elements of unrest with
which the new sovereign had to contend on his
northern borders&mdash;the crazy fanaticism of fierce
Cameronians&mdash;the sturdy, cantankerous zeal of
Presbyterians&mdash;the workings of the old, hot, obstinate
leaven of Prelacy, and the romantic, lingering
loyalty to a Stuart king.</p>

<p>But William ended by having all his kingdom
well in hand, and all his household too. There was
strong affection between William and Mary; he relishing
her discretion, her reserves, and her culture;
and she loving enough to forget the harsh gauntleted
hand which he put upon those who were nearest
and dearest to him. He was more military than
diplomatic, and I think believed in no Scripture
more devoutly than in that which sets forth the
mandate, “Wives, obey your husbands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>The King was not a strong man physically, though
a capital soldier; he was short, awkward, halting in
movement, appearing best in the saddle and with
battle flaming in his front; he had asthma, too, fearfully;
was irritable&mdash;full of coughs and colds&mdash;building
a new palace upon the flank of Hampton
Court, to get outside of London smoke and fogs;
setting out trees there, and digging ponds in Dutch
style, which you may see now; building Kensington,
too, which was then out of town, and planting and
digging there&mdash;of which you may see results over
the mouldy brick wall that still hems in that old
abode of royalty. He carried his asthma, and dyspepsia,
and smoking Dutch dragoons to both places.
People thought surely that the Queen, so well made
and blessed with wonderful appetite, would outlive
him, and so give to the history of England a Mary II.;
but she did not. An attack of small-pox, not
combated in those days by vaccination, or even inoculation,
carried her off on a short illness.</p>

<p>He grieved, as people thought so stern a master
could not grieve; but rallied and built to the
Queen’s memory that most magnificent of monuments,
Greenwich Hospital, which shows its domes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and its royal façade stretching along the river bank,
to the myriad of strangers who every year sail up
or down the Thames.</p>

<p>He made friends, too, with Princess Anne, the sister
of the dead Queen, and now heir to the throne.
This Princess Anne (afterward Queen Anne) was
married to a prince of Denmark, only notable for
doing nothing excellently well; and was mother of
a young lad, called Duke of Gloucester, whom all
England looked upon as their future king. And
this little Duke, after Queen Mary’s death, came to
be presented at court in a blue velvet costume,
blazing all over with diamonds, of which one may
get a good notion from Sir Godfrey Kneller’s painting
of him, now in Hampton Court. But the velvet
and the diamonds and best of care could not save
the weakly, blue-eyed, fair-cheeked, precocious lad;
his precocity was a fatal one, due to a big hydrocephalic
head that bent him down and carried him
to the grave while William was yet King.</p>

<p>The Princess mother was in despair; was herself
feeble, too; small, heavy, dropsical, from all which
she rallied, however, and at the death of William,
which occurred by a fall from his horse in 1702,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
came to be that Queen Anne, who through no
special virtues of her own, gave a name to a great
epoch in English history, and in these latter days
has given a name to very much architecture and
furniture and crockery, which have as little to do
with her as they have with our King Benjamin of
Washington.</p>

<p>I may have more to say of her when we shall
have brought the literary current of our story more
nearly abreast of her times.</p>

<p>There was not much of literary patronage flowing
out from King William. I think there was
never a time when he would not have counted a
good dictionary the best of books, not excepting
the Bible; and I suspect that he had about the
same contempt for “literary fellers” which belongs
to our average Congressman. Yet there were
shoals of poets in his time who would have delighted
to burn incense under the nostrils of the
asthmatic King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<h3>Some Literary Fellows.</h3>

<p>There was Prior,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> for instance, who, from having
been the son of a taverner at Whitehall, came to be
a polished wit, and at last an ambassador, through
the influence of strong friends about the court. In
his university days he had ventured to ridicule, in
rattling verse, the utterances of the great Dryden.
You will know of him best, perhaps, if you know
him at all, by a paraphrase he made of that tender
ballad of the “Nut-brown Maid,” in which the
charming naturalness of the old verse is stuck over
with the black patches of Prior’s pretty rhetoric.
But I am tempted to give you a fairer and a more
characteristic specimen of his vivacity and grace.
Here it is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What I speak, my fair Chloe, and what I write, shows</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The difference there is betwixt nature and art;</div>
<div class="verse">I court <em>others</em> in verse; but I love <em>thee</em> in prose;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And <em>they</em> have my whimsies, but <em>thou</em> hast my heart.</div>
<div class="verse">So when I am wearied with wandering all day,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To thee, my delight, in the evening I come,</div>
<div class="verse">No matter what beauties I saw in my way;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">They were but my <em>visits</em>, and thou art my home.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>
<p>Remember, these lines were written by a poet,
who on an important occasion represented the
Government of Queen Anne at the great court of
Louis XIV. of France. This Prior&mdash;when Queen
Mary died&mdash;had his consolatory verses for King
William. Indeed that death of Queen Mary set a
great deal of poetry upon the flow. There was
William Congreve,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> who though a young man, not
yet turned of thirty, had won a great rank in those
days by his witty comedies. He wrote a pastoral&mdash;cleaner
than most of his writing&mdash;in honor of
William’s lost Queen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“No more these woods shall with her sight be blest,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor with her feet these flowery plains be prest;</div>
<div class="verse">No more the winds shall with her tresses play,</div>
<div class="verse">And from her balmy breath steal sweets away.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, she was heavenly fair, in face and mind,</div>
<div class="verse">Never in nature were such beauties joined;</div>
<div class="verse">Without&mdash;all shining, and within&mdash;all white;</div>
<div class="verse">Pure to the sense, and pleasing to the sight;</div>
<div class="verse">Like some rare flower, whose leaves all colors yield,</div>
<div class="verse">And&mdash;opening&mdash;is with sweetest odors filled.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>
<p>Yet all this would have comforted the King not
half so much as a whiff of smoke from the pipe of
one of his Dutch dragoons. He never went to see
one of Mr. Congreve’s plays, though the whole town
was talking of their neatness, and their skill, and
their wit. That clever gentleman’s conquests on
the stage, and in the social world&mdash;lording it as he
did among duchesses and countesses&mdash;would have
weighed with King William not so much as the
buzzing of a blue-bottle fly.</p>

<p>Yet Congreve was in his way an important man&mdash;immensely
admired; Voltaire said he was the
best comedy writer England had ever known; and
when he came to London this keen-witted Frenchman
(who rarely visited) went to see Mr. Congreve
at his rooms in the Strand. Nothing was too good
for Mr. Congreve; he had patronage and great
gifts; it seemed always to be raining roses on his
head. The work he did was not great work, but
it was exquisitely done; though, it must be said,
there was no preserving savor in it but the art
of it. The talk in his comedies, by its pliancy,
grace, neat turns, swiftness of repartee, compares
with the talk in most comedies as goldsmith’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
work compares with the heavy forgings of a blacksmith.
It matches exquisitely part to part, and
runs as delicately as a hair-spring on jewelled pinions.</p>

<p>I gave my readers a bit of the “Pandora Lament,”
which Sir Richard Steele thought one of
the most perfect of all pastoral compositions. And
the little whimsey about Amoret, everybody knows;
certainly it is best known of all he did:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Coquet and coy at once her air,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Both studied, tho’ both seemed neglected;</div>
<div class="verse">Careless she is with artful care,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Affecting to seem unaffected.</div>
<div class="verse">With skill her eyes dart every glance,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Yet change so soon, you’d ne’er suspect ’em,</div>
<div class="verse">For she’d persuade they wound by chance,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Tho’ certain aim and art direct them.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">They are very pretty; yet are you not sure that
our wheezing, phlegmatic, business-loving, Dutch
King William would have sniffed contemptuously
at the reading of any such verselets?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<h3>A Pamphleteer.</h3>

<p>A writer, however, of that time, of about the
same age with Congreve, whom King William did
favor, and did take at one period into his confidence,&mdash;and
one of whose books, at least, you all
have liked at some epoch of your life, and thought
quite wonderful and charming&mdash;I must tell you
more about. His presence counted for nothing; he
was short, wiry, hook-nosed&mdash;not anyway elegant;
Mr. Congreve would have scorned association with
him. He was the son of a small butcher in London,
and had never much schooling; but he was
quick of apprehension, always eager to inform himself;
bustling, shrewd, inquisitive, with abundance
of what we call “cheek.” He never lacked simple,
strong language to tell just what he thought, or
what he knew; and he never lacked the courage to
put his language into print or into speech, as the
case might be.</p>

<p>By dint of his dogged perseverance and much
natural aptitude he came to know Latin and Spanish
and Italian, and could speak French, such as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was, very fluently. He was well up in geography
and history, and such science as went into the books
of those days. He wrote sharp, stinging pamphlets
about whatever struck him as wrong, or as wanting
a good slap, whether in morals, manners, or politics.</p>

<p>He was in trade, which took him sometimes into
France, Spain, or Flanders. He could tell everyone
how to make money and how to conduct business
better than he could do either himself. He had
his bankruptcies, his hidings, his compoundings
with creditors, and his times in prison; but he
came out of all these experiences with just as much
animation and pluck and assurance as he carried
into them.</p>

<p>There was a time when he was advertised as a
fugitive, and a reward offered for his apprehension&mdash;all
due to his sharp pamphlet-writing; and he
was apprehended and had his fines to pay, and
stood in the pillory; but the street-folk, with a
love for his pluck and for his trenchant, homely,
outspokenness, garnished the pillory with flowers
and garlands. It was this power of incisive speech,
and his capacity to win audience of the street-people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
that made King William value his gifts
and put them to service.</p>

<p>But I cannot tell of the half he wrote. Now it
was upon management of families; again an <cite>Essay
on Projects</cite>&mdash;from which Dr. Franklin used to
say he derived a great many valuable hints&mdash;then
upon a standing army; then upon the villainies of
stock-jobbery. What he called poems, too, he
wrote, with a harsh jingle of rhymes; one specially,
showing that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“as the world goes, and is like to go, the best way for
Ladies is to keep unmarried, for I will ever expose,”
he says, “these infamous, impertinent, cowardly, censorious,
sauntering <em>Idle wretches</em>, called <em>Wits</em> and <em>Beaux</em>,
the <em>Plague</em> of the nation and the <em>Scandal</em> of mankind.”
But, he continues, “if Lesbia is sure she has found a
man of <em>Honor</em>, <em>Religion</em> and <em>Virtue</em>, I will never forbid
the <em>Banns</em>: Let her love him as much as she pleases,
and value him as an <em>Angel</em>, and be married to-morrow if
she will.”</p>

</div>

<p>Again, he has a whole volume of <cite>Advice to English
Tradesmen</cite>, as to how to manage their shops
and bargainings; and it gives one a curious notion
of what was counted idle extravagance in that
day to read his description of the extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and absurd expenditure of a certain insane pastry-cook:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It will hardly be believed,” he says, “in ages to come,
that the fitting of his shop has cost 300 pounds! I have
good authority for saying that this spendthrift has sash-windows
all of looking-glass plate twelve inches by sixteen&mdash;two
large pier looking-glasses, and one very large pier-glass
seven feet high; and all the walls of the shop are
lined up with galley tiles.”</p>

</div>

<p>He advises a young apothecary who has not large
acquaintance to hire a stout man to pound in a
big mortar (though he may have nothing to pound)
all the early hours of the morning, and all the evening,
as if he were a man of great practice. Then,
in his <cite>Family Instructor</cite>, he advises against untruth
and all hypocrisies; and he compresses
sharp pamphlets into the shape of a leading article&mdash;is,
in fact, the first man to design “leading articles,”
which he puts into his <cite>Review</cite> or <cite>Indicator</cite>,
in which periodicals he saves a corner for well-spiced
gossip and scandal, to make&mdash;he says&mdash;the
“paper relished by housewives.” He interviews all
the cut-throats and thieves encountered in prison,
and tells stories of their lives. I think he was the
first and best of all interviewers; but not the last!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Fifty of these pages of mine would scarce take in
the mere titles of the books and pamphlets he
wrote. His career stretched far down throughout
Queen Anne’s days, and was parallel with that of
many worthy men of letters, I shall have to mention;
yet he knew familiarly none of them. Swift,
who knew everybody he thought worth knowing,
speaks of him as an illiterate fellow, whose name he
has forgotten; and our pamphleteer dies at last&mdash;in
hiding&mdash;poor, embroiled with his family, and
sought by very few&mdash;unless his creditors.</p>

<p>I do not suppose you have read much that he
wrote except one book; that, I know you have
read; and this bustling, bouncing, inconsistent, indefatigable,
unsuccessful, earnest scold of a man
was named Daniel Defoe;<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and the book you have
read is <cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite>&mdash;loved by all boys
better than any other book; and loved by all girls,
I think, better than any other book&mdash;that has no
love in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>You will wonder, perhaps, that a man without
academic graces of speech should have made a
book that wears so and that wins so. But it wears
and wins, because&mdash;for one thing&mdash;it is free from
any extraneous graces of rhetoric; because he was
not trying to write a fine book, but only to tell in
clearest way a plain story. And if you should ever
have any story of your own to tell, and want to tell
it well, I advise you to take <cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite> for
a model; if you ever want to make a good record
of any adventures of your own by sea, or by land, I
advise you to take <cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite> for a model;
and if you do, you will not waste words in painting
sunsets, or in decorating storms and sea-waves;
but, without your straining, and by the simple colorless
truth of your language, the sunsets will show
their glow, and the storms rise and roar, and the
waves dash and die along the beach as they do in
nature.</p>

<h3>Of Queen Anne.</h3>

<p>Though not in great favor with the courtiers of
Queen Anne, Defoe did serve her government effectively
upon the Commission in Edinburgh, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
brought about in this Queen’s time (and to her
great honor) the legislative union of England and
Scotland. She came, you know, to be called the
“Good Queen Anne;” and we must try and get a
better glimpse of her before we push on with our
literary story. Royal duties brought more ripeness
of character than her young days promised. I
have said that she was not so attractive personally
as her sister Mary; not tall, but heavy in figure&mdash;not
unlike the present good Queen of England, but
less active by far; sometimes dropsical&mdash;gouty,
too, and never getting over a strong love for the
table. She had great waves of brown hair&mdash;ringleted
and flowing over her shoulders; and she had
an arm and hand which Sir Godfrey Kneller&mdash;who
painted her&mdash;declared to be the finest in all England;
and whoso is curious in such matters can
still see that wonderful hand and arm in her portrait
at Windsor. Another charm she possessed
was a singularly sweet and sympathetic voice; and
she read the royal messages to the high court of
Parliament with a music that has never been put
in them since. If she had written them herself, I
am afraid music would not have saved them; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
she was not strong-minded, and was a shallow
student; she <em>would</em> spell phonetically, and played
havoc with the tenses. Nor was she rich in conversation,
or full. Swift&mdash;somewhere in his journal&mdash;makes
merry with her disposition to help
out&mdash;as so many of us do&mdash;by talk about the
weather; and there is a story that when, after
King William’s death, the great Marquis of Normanby
came on a visit of sympathy and gratulation
to the new sovereign, the Queen, at an awkward
pause, piped out, in her sweet voice: “It’s a
fine day, Marquis!” Whereat the courtier, who
was more full of dainty speech, said&mdash;in pretty
recognition of its being the first day of her reign&mdash;“Your
Majesty must allow me to say that it’s
the finest day I ever saw in my life!” But this
good Queen was full of charities, always beloved,
and never failed to show that best mark of real
ladyhood&mdash;the utmost courtesy and kindliness of
manner to dependants and to her servants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<h3>An Irish Dragoon.</h3>

<p>Among the writers specially identified with this
Queen’s reign was Sir Richard Steele;<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> not a
grand man, or one of large influence; and yet one
so kindly by nature, and so gracious in his speech
and writing, that the world is not yet done with pardoning,
and loving, and pitying that elegant author
of the <cite>Tatler</cite>&mdash;though he was an awful spendthrift,
and a fashionable tippler, and a creature of
always splendid, and always broken, promises.</p>

<p>He was Irish born; was schooled at the Charter-house
in London, where he met with that other
master of delicate English, Joseph Addison&mdash;they
being not far from the same age&mdash;and knitting
a boy friendship there which withstood a great
many shocks of manhood. They were together at
Oxford, too, but not long; for Steele, somehow,
slipped College early and became a trooper, and
learned all the ways of the fast fellows of the town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
With such a training&mdash;on the road to which his
Irish blood led him with great jollity&mdash;one would
hardly have looked to him for any early talk
about the life of a true <cite>Christian Hero</cite>. But he
did write a book so entitled, in those wild young
days, as a sort of kedge anchor, he says, whereby
he might haul out from the shoals of the wicked
town, and indulge in a sort of contemplative piety.
It was and is a very good little book;<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> but it did
not hold a bit, as an anchor. And when he came
to be joked about his Christian Heroship, he wrote
plays (perhaps to make averages good) more moral
and cleanly than those of Etherege or Wycherley&mdash;with
bright things in them; but not enough
of such, or of orderly proprieties, to keep them
popular. Of course, this fun-loving, dusky, good-hearted,
broad-shouldered Irish trooper falls in
love easily; marries, too, of a sudden, some West
Indian lady, who dies within a year, leaving him
a Barbadoes estate&mdash;said to be large&mdash;does look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
large to Captain Steele through his cups&mdash;but
which gives greater anxieties than profits, and is
a sort of castle in Spain all through his life. With
almost incredible despatch&mdash;after this affliction&mdash;he
is in love again; this time with the only daughter
of a rich Welsh lady. This is his famous
Prue, who plays the coquette with him for a while;
but writes privily to her anxious mamma that she
“can <em>never, never</em> love another;” that “he is not
high&mdash;nor rich&mdash;but so dutiful; and for his
morals and understanding [she says] I refer you
to his <cite>Christian Hero</cite>.”</p>

<p>Steele’s marriage comes of it&mdash;a marriage whose
ups and downs, and lights and shadows have curious
and very graphic illustration in the storm of
notelets which he wrote to his wife&mdash;on bill-heads,
perfumed paper, tavern reckonings&mdash;all, singularly
enough, in existence now, and carefully kept in the
Library of the British Museum.</p>

<p>Here is a part of one, written just before his marriage:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Madam, it is the hardest thing in the World to be in
Love, and yet attend Business. As for me all that speak to
me find me out.… A gentleman ask’d me this morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
what news from Lisbon, and I answered, ‘She’s exquisitely
handsome.’” Here’s another&mdash;after marriage:
“Dear Prue, I enclose two guineas, and will come home exactly
at seven. Yrs tenderly.” And again: “Dear Prue,
I enclose five guineas, but cannot come home to dinner.
Dear little woman, take care of thyself, and eat and drink
cheerfully.” Yet again: “Dear Prue, if you do not hear
of me before three to-morrow, believe that I am too [tipsy]
to obey your orders; but, however, know me to be your
most affectionate, faithful husband.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is more promising for a man to speak of his
own tippling than to have others speak of it; nor
was this writer’s sinning in that way probably beyond
the average in his time. But he was of that
mercurial temperament which took wine straight
to the brain; and so was always at bad odds with
those men of better digestion (such as Swift and
Addison) who were only tickled effusively with
such bouts as lifted the hilarious Captain Steele
into a noisy effervescence.</p>

<p>There are better and worse letters than those I
have read; but never any lack of averment that he
enjoys most of anything in life his wife’s delightful
presence&mdash;but can’t get home, really cannot; some
excellent fellows have come in, or he is at the tavern&mdash;business
is important; and she is always his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
charming Prue; and always he twists a little wordy
aureole of praise about her head or her curls. I
suppose she took a deal of comfort out of his tender
adjectives; but I think she learned early not to
sit up for him, and got over that married woe with
great alacrity. There is evidence that she loved
him throughout; and other evidence that she gave
him some moral fisticuffs&mdash;when he did get home&mdash;which
made his next stay at the tavern easier and
more defensible.</p>

<p>But he loved his Prue, in his way, all her life
through, and showed a beautiful fondness for his
children. In that budget of notelets I spoke of
(and which the wife so carefully cherished), are
some charming ones to his children: thus he writes
to his daughter Elizabeth, whose younger sister,
Mary, has just begun to put her initials, M. S., to
messages of love to him:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Tell her I am delighted: tell her how many fine things
those two letters stand for when she writes them: <em>M. S.</em>
is <em>milk and sugar</em>; <em>mirth and safety</em>; <em>musick and songs</em>;
<em>meat and sauce</em>, as well as <em>Molly and Spot</em>, and <em>Mary and
Steele</em>. You see I take pleasure in conversing with you by
prattling anything to divert you.</p>

<p class="right">Yr aff. father.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>But you must not think Steele was a man of no
importance save in his own family. His friends
counted by scores and hundreds; he had warm
patrons among the chiefest men of the time; had
political preferment and places of trust and profit,
far better than his old captaincy; could have lived
in handsome style and without anxieties, if his
reckless kindnesses and convivialities had not made
him improvident.</p>

<h3>Steele’s Literary Qualities.</h3>

<p>Nor must we forget the work by which he is
chiefly known, I mean his establishment of the
<cite>Tatler</cite>&mdash;the forerunner of all those delightful essays
which went to the making of the <cite>Spectator</cite> and
the <cite>Guardian</cite>; these latter having the more credit
for their dignity and wise reticence, but the <cite>Tatler</cite>
being more vivacious, and quite as witty. Addison
came to the help of Steele in the <cite>Tatler</cite>, and Steele,
afterward joined forces with Addison in the <cite>Spectator</cite>.
I happen to be the owner of a very old
edition of these latter essays, in whose “Table of
Contents” some staid critic of the last generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
has written his (or her) comments on the various
topics discussed; and I find against the papers of
Addison, such notes as&mdash;“<em>instructive</em>, <em>sound</em>, <em>judicious</em>;”
and against those of Steele, I am sorry
to say, such words as “<em>flighty</em>, <em>light</em>, <em>witty</em>, <em>graceful</em>,
<em>worthless</em>;” and I am inclined to think the criticisms
are pretty well borne out by the papers; but if
<em>flighty</em> and <em>light</em>, he was not unwholesome; and
he did not always carry the rollicking ways of the
tavern into the little piquant journalism, where the
grave and excellent Mr. Addison presided with him.
Nay, there are better things yet to be said of him.
He argued against the sin and folly of duelling
with a force and pungency that went largely to stay
that evil; and he never touches a religious topic
that his manner does not take on an awe and a
respect which belongs to the early pages of the
<cite>Christian Hero</cite>. There are touches of pathos, too,
in his writing, quite unmatchable; but straight
and quick upon these you are apt to catch sound
of the jingling spurs of the captain of dragoons.
Thus, in that often quoted allusion to his
father’s death (which happened in his boyhood),
he says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I went into the room where his body lay, and my
mother sat weeping alone by it. I had my battledore in
my hand, and fell a beating the coffin, and calling ‘Papa.’…
My mother catched me in her arms, and almost
smothered me in her embraces, and told me, in a flood of
tears, ‘Papa could not hear me, and would play with me no
more.’”</p>

</div>

<p>This is on page 364 of the <cite>Tatler</cite>, and on page
365 he says: “A large train of disasters were coming
into my memory, when my servant knocked at
my closet door, and interrupted me with a letter,
attended with a hamper of wine, of the same sort
with that which is to be put to sale on Thursday
next, at Garraway’s coffee-house.” And he sends
for three of his friends&mdash;which was so like him!</p>

<p>So he goes through life&mdash;a kindly, good-hearted,
tender, intractable, winning fellow; talking, odd-whiles,
piously&mdash;spending freely&mdash;drinking fearlessly&mdash;loving
widely&mdash;writing archly, wittily,
charmingly.</p>

<p>We have a characteristic glimpse of him in his
later years&mdash;for he lived far down into the days of
the Georges (one of whom gave him his knighthood
and title)&mdash;when he is palsied, at his charming
country home in Wales, and totters out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
see the village girls dance upon the green, and
insists upon sending off to buy a new gown for
the best dancer; this was so like him! And it
would have been like him to carry his palsied
steps straight thereafter to the grave where his
Prue and the memory of all his married joys and
hopes lay sleeping.</p>

<h3>Joseph Addison.</h3>

<p>Addison’s character was, in a measure, the complement
of Steele’s. He was coy, dignified, reticent&mdash;not
given to easy familiarities at sight&mdash;nor
greatly prone to over-fondling. He was the
son of an English rector down in Wiltshire; was
born in a cottage still standing in Milston&mdash;a few
miles north of Salisbury. He was a Charter-house
boy and Oxford man; had great repute there as
scholar&mdash;specially as Latinist&mdash;became a Fellow&mdash;had
great Whig friends, who, somehow, secured
him a pension, with which he set out upon European
travel; and he wrote about what he saw in
Italy, and other parts, in a way that is fresh and
readable now. He was a year or two younger than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Congreve, and a few weeks<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> only younger than
Steele; nine years younger than De Foe, of whom
it is probable he never knew or cared to know.</p>

<p>Very early in his career Addison had the aid of
Government friends: his dignity of carriage gave
them assurance; his reticence forbade fear of babbling;
his elegant pen gave hope of good service;
and he came to high political task-work&mdash;first, in
those famous verses where he likens the fighting
hero, Marlborough&mdash;then fresh from Blenheim&mdash;to
the angel, who,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“&mdash;&mdash;by Divine command,</div>
<div class="verse">With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,</div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>
<div class="verse">And pleased th’ Almighty’s orders to perform,</div>
<div class="verse">Rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That poem took him out from scholarly obscurity,
and set him well afoot in the waiting-rooms
of statesmen. Poetry, however, was not to be his
office; though, some years after, he did win the
town by the academic beauties of his tragedy of
“Cato”&mdash;the memory of which has come bobbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
down over school-benches, by the “Speech of
Sempronius,” to days some of us remember&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent3">“&mdash;&mdash;My voice is still for war!</div>
<div class="verse">Gods, can a Roman Senate long debate</div>
<div class="verse">Which of the two to choose&mdash;slavery or death!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I suppose that speech may have slipped out of
modern reader-books; but it used to make one of
the stock declamations, on which ambitious school-boys
of my time spent great floods of fervid elocution.</p>

<p>Addison wrote somewhat, as I have said, for
Steele’s first periodic venture in the <cite>Tatler</cite>, attracted
by its opportunities and the graces of it;
and they together plotted and carried into execution
the publication of the <cite>Spectator</cite>. I trust that
its quiet elegance has not altogether fallen away
from the knowledge of this generation of young
people. Dr. Johnson, you know, said of its Addison
papers, that whoever would write English well
should give his days and nights to their perusal.
Yet such a journal could and would never succeed
now: it does not deal with questions of large
and vital interest; its sentences do not crackle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and blaze with the heat we look for in the
preachments of our time. Its leisurely discourse&mdash;placid
as summer brooks&mdash;would beguile us to
sleep. A ream of old <cite>Spectators</cite> discussing proprieties
and modesties would not put one of our daring
ball-room belles to the blush. The talk of
these old gentlemen about the minor morals were
too mild, perhaps too merciful; yet it is well to
know of them; and one can go to a great many
worse quarters than the <cite>Spectator</cite>, even now, for
proper hints about etiquette, manners, and social
proprieties.</p>

<h3>Sir Roger De Coverley.</h3>

<p>Whatever other writings of these gallant gentlemen
and teachers of Queen Anne’s time the reader
may have upon his shelves, he cannot do better
than equip them with that little story (excerpted
from the <cite>Spectator</cite>) of “Sir Roger De Coverley.”
No truer or more winning picture of worthy old
English knighthood can you find anywhere in literature;
nowhere such a tender twilight color falling
through books upon old English country homes.
Those papers made the scaffolding by which our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
own Irving built up his best stories about English
country homesteads, and English revels of Christmas;
and the De Coverley echoes sound sweetly
and surely all up and down the pages of <cite>Bracebridge
Hall</cite>.</p>

<p>The character of Sir Roger will live forever&mdash;so
gracious&mdash;so courteous&mdash;so dignified&mdash;so gentle:
his servants love him, and his dogs, and his white
gelding.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It being a cold day,” says his old butler, “when he
made his will, he left for mourning to every man in the
parish a great frieze coat, and to every woman a black riding-hood.
Captain Sentry showed great kindnesses to the
old house-dog my master was so fond of. It would have
gone to your heart to have heard the moans the dumb creature
made on the day of my master’s death. He has never
joyed himself since&mdash;no more has any of us.”</p>

</div>

<p>Yet there were plenty of folks who sneered at
these papers even then&mdash;as small&mdash;not worthy
of notice. That great, bustling, slashing, literary
giant, Dean Swift, says to Mistress Hester Johnson,
“Do you read the <cite>Spectators</cite>? I never do;
they never come in my way. They say abundance
of them are very pretty.” “Very pretty!”
a vast many satiric shots have been fired off to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
that tune. And yet Swift and Addison had been
as friendly as two men so utterly unlike could be.</p>

<p>To complete the De Coverley picture, and give it
relish in the boudoirs of the time, the authors paint
the old knight in love&mdash;delicately, but deeply and
wofully in love&mdash;with a certain unnamed widow
living near him, and whose country house overlooks
the park of the De Coverley estate.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Oh, the many moonlight nights that I have walked by
myself, and thought on the widow, by the music of the
nightingales!”</p>

</div>

<p>This sounds like Steele. And the old knight
leaves to her</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whom he has loved for forty years, a pearl necklace
that was his mother’s, and a couple of silver bracelets set
with jewels.”</p>

</div>

<p>This episode has an added interest, because about
those times the dignified and coy Mr. Addison was
very much bent upon marrying the elegant Lady
Warwick, whose son had been correspondent&mdash;perhaps
pupil of his. He did not bounce into
marriage&mdash;like Steele&mdash;with his whole heart in
his eyes and his speech; it was a long pursuit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and had its doubtful stages; six years before the
affair really came about, he used to write to the
Warwick lad about the tom-tits, and the robin-redbreasts,
and their pretty nests, and the nightingales.
But Addison, more or less fortunate than
Sir Roger, does win the widow’s hand, and has a
sorry time of it with her. She never forgets to
look a little down upon him, and he never forgets
a keen knowledge of it.</p>

<p>He has the liberty, however, after his marriage&mdash;with
certain limitations&mdash;of a great fine home at
Holland House, which is one of the few old country
houses still standing in London, in the midst of the
gardens, where Addison used to walk, in preference
to my Lady’s chamber. His habits were to study
of a morning&mdash;dine at a tavern; then to Button’s
coffee-house, near to Covent Garden, for a meet
with his cronies; and afterward&mdash;when the spectre
of marriage was real to him&mdash;to the tavern again,
and to heavier draughts than he was wont to take
in his young days.</p>

<p>Pope said he was charming in his talk; but never
so in mixed company; never when the auditors
were so new or so many as to rouse his self-consciousness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
this tied his tongue; but with one or
two he knew well, the stream of the <cite>Spectator’s</cite> talk
flowed as limpidly as from his pen.</p>

<p>He was not a great student; Bentley would have
laughed at hearing him called so. But he could
use the learning he had with rare deftness, and
make more out of a page of the ancients than
Bentley could make out of a volume. His graces
of speech, and aptitude for using a chance nugget
of knowledge, made him subject of sneer from
those who studied hard and long. A man who
beats his brains against books everlastingly, without
great conquests, is apt to think lightly of the
gifts of one like Addison, who by mere impact gets
a gracious send-off into elegant talk.</p>

<p>If one has read nothing else of Addison’s, I think
he may read with profit the “Vision of Mirza.”
That, too, used to be one of the jewels in the ancient
reader-books, and had so many of the graces
of a story, that the book&mdash;my book at least&mdash;used
to fall open of itself on those pages where began
the wonderful vision in the Valley of Bagdad.</p>

<p>Though more years have passed since my reading
of it than I dare tell, yet at the bare mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of the name I seem to see the great clouds of
mist which gather on the hither and the thither
sides of the valley: I see the haunting Genius in
the costume of a shepherd, who from his little musical
instrument makes sounds that are exceeding
sweet.</p>

<p>Then I seem to see the prodigious tide of water
rolling through the valley, and the long bridge
with the crumbling arches stretching athwart the
stream, and the throngs of people crowding over,
and falling and slipping into the angry tide&mdash;which
is the tide of death; I see that the larger
number fall through into the waters, when they
have scarce passed over a single arch of the bridge.
But whatever may befall, always the throng is
pressing on, and always the thousands are dropping
away and disappearing in the gulf that
sweeps below. I see that, though some few hobble
along painfully upon the furthermost and half-broken
arches that stand in the flood, not one of
all the myriads passes over in safety; and I behold
again (with Mirza) that beyond&mdash;far beyond,
where the clouds of mist have lifted&mdash;lies a stretch
of placid water, with islands covered with fruits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and flowers, and a thousand little shining seas
run in and out among these Islands of the Blessed.
And when I look the other way, to see what may
lie under the other and darker clouds of mist, lo!
the shepherd who has conjured the Vision is gone;
and instead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge,
the crowding myriads, I see nothing but the long,
hollow Valley of Bagdad, with oxen, sheep, and
camels grazing upon the sides of it. It seemed
to me, fifty years ago, that a man who could make
such visions appear, ought to keep on making
them appear, all his life long.</p>

<p>I have said nothing of the political life of
Addison; there are no high lights in it that send
their flashes down to us. He held places, indeed,
of much consideration; his aptitudes, his courtesies,
his discretion, his sagacities always won respect;
but he was never a force in politics; the
only time he attempted parliamentary speaking
he broke down; but with a pen in his hand
he never broke down until failing health and
latter-day anxieties of many sorts shook his power.
I have already hinted at the probable infelicities of
his late and distinguished marriage; whatever else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
may be true of it (and authorities are conflicting),
it certainly did not bring access of youth or ambition
or joyousness.</p>

<p>In his later years, too, there came a quarrel with
his old friend Steele&mdash;cutting more deeply into
the heart of this reticent man than it could cut
into the much-scarified heart of that impressionist,
the author of the <cite>Tatler</cite>; there were stories,
too, pretty well supported, that Addison in those
last weary days of his&mdash;feeble and asthmatic&mdash;drank
over-freely, to spur his jaded mind up to a
level with the talk of sympathizing friends.</p>

<p>Pope, too, in those times, had possibly aggravated
the quiet, calm essayist, with the sting of
his splendid but scorpion pen;<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and all accounts
assure us that Addison (though under fifty) did
give a most kindly welcome to death. The story
told by Young, and repeated by Dr. Johnson, of
his summoning young Warwick to see how a
Christian could die, is very likely apocryphal. It
was not like him; this modest philosopher never
made himself an exemplar of the virtues. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
know, however, that he died calmly and tranquilly.
Who can hope for more?</p>

<p>Not many legacies have come down to us from
those days of Queen Anne which are worthier than
his; and all owe gratitude to him for at least one
shining page in all our hymnals: it will keep the
name of Addison among the stars.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="dropcap">In our last talk we had an opening skirmish with
a group of royal people; we saw James II.
flitting away ignominiously from a throne he could
not fill or hold; we saw that rough fighter, the
opinionated William III., coming to his honors&mdash;holding
hard, and with gauntleted hand, his amiable
consort, Queen Mary. I spoke of the relationship
of these two; also had some fore-words about
Mary’s sister, the future Queen Anne, and about
the death of her boy, the little Duke of Gloucester.</p>

<p>I had something to say of that easy and artful
poet, Matthew Prior, who smartly wrote his way,
by judicious panegyrics and well-metred song, from
humble station to that of ambassador at the court
of France. We had a taste of the elegant Congreve,
and said much of that bouncer of a man
Daniel De Foe; the character of this latter we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
greatly esteem&mdash;but when can we cease to admire
the talent that gave to us the story of <cite>Robinson
Crusoe</cite>?</p>

<p>Then I spoke to you of Sir Richard Steele&mdash;poor
Steele! poor Prue! And I spoke also of his
friend Addison, the courtly, the reticent, the graceful,
and the good. All of these men outlived William
and Mary; all of them shone&mdash;in their several
ways&mdash;through the days of Queen Anne.</p>

<h3>Royal Griefs and Friends.</h3>

<p>Mary, consort of William III., died some six
years before the close of the century; she was honestly
mourned for by the nation; and I cited some
of the tender music which belonged to certain poetic
lamentations at the going off of the gentle
Queen. The little boy prince, Gloucester, presumptive
heir to the throne, died in 1700 (so did
John Dryden and Sir William Temple). Scarce
two years thereafter and William III.&mdash;who was
invalided in his latter days, and took frequent out-of-door
exercise&mdash;was thrown from his horse in
passing over the roads&mdash;not so smooth as now&mdash;between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Hampton Court and Kensington. There
was some bone-breakage and bruises, which, like a
good soldier, he made light of. In the enforced
confinement that followed, he struggled bravely to
fulfil royal duties; but within a fortnight, as he
listened to Albemarle, who brought news about affairs
in Holland, it was observed that his eyes wandered,
and his only comment&mdash;whose comments
had always been like hammer-strokes&mdash;was, “I’m
drawing to the end.”<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Two days after he died.</p>

<p>Then the palace doors opened for that “good,”
and certainly weak, Queen Anne, whose name is so
intimately associated with what is called “the Augustan
age” of English letters, and whose personal
characteristics have already been subjects of mention.
She was hardly recovered from her grief at
the death of her prince-boy, and was supported at
her advent upon royalty by that conspicuous friend
of her girl years and constant associate, Sarah,
Duchess of Marlborough. It would be hard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
reach any proper understanding of social and court
influences in Anne’s time, without bringing into
view the sharp qualities of this First Lady of her
Chamber. Very few historians have a good word
to say for her. She was the wife of that illustrious
general, John of Marlborough, whom we all associate
with his important victories of Blenheim and
of Ramillies; and in whose honor was erected the
great memorial column in the Park of Woodstock,
where every American traveller should go to see
remnants of an old royal forest, and to see also the
brilliant palace of Blenheim, with its splendid
trophies, all given by the nation&mdash;at the warm
urgence of Queen Anne&mdash;in honor of the conquering
general.</p>

<p>You know the character of Marlborough&mdash;elegant,
selfish, politic, treacherous betimes, brave,
greedy, sagacious, and avaricious to the last degree.
He made a great figure in William’s time, and still
greater in Anne’s reign; his Duchess, too, figured
conspicuously in her court. She was as enterprising
as the Duke, and as money-loving&mdash;having
smiles and frowns and tears at command, by
which she wheedled or swayed whom she would.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
She did not believe in charities that went beyond
the house of Marlborough; in fact, this ancestress
of the Churchills was reckoned by most as a harpy
and an elegant vampire. Never a Queen was so
beleaguered with such a friend; she was keeper of
the privy purse, and Anne found it hard (as current
stories ran) to get money from her for her private
charities; hard, indeed, to dispose of her cast-off
silken robes as she desired. Why, you ask, did
she not blaze up into a flame of anger and of resolve,
and bid the Duchess, once for all, begone?
Why are some women born weak and patient of the
chains that bind them? And why are others born
with a cold, imperious disdain and power that tells
on weaklings, and makes the space all round them
glitter with their sovereignty?</p>

<p>When this Sarah of Marlborough was first in
waiting upon the Princess Anne, neither Duke nor
Duchess (without titles then) could count enough
moneys between them to keep a private carriage
for their service; and before the Duke died their
joint revenues amounted to £94,000 per annum.</p>

<p>Then the great park at Woodstock became ducal
property. I have said it was richly worth visiting;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
its encircling wall is twelve miles in length; the
oaks are magnificent; the artificial waters skirt
gardens and shrubberies that extend over three
hundred acres; the grass is velvety; the fallow
deer are in troops of hundreds. And one must remember,
in visiting the locality, that there stood
the ancient and renowned royal mansion of Henry
II.&mdash;that there was born the Black Prince&mdash;and,
very probably, Chaucer may have wandered thereabout,
and studied the “daisies white,” and listened
to the whirring of the pheasants&mdash;a wood-music
one may hear now in all the remoter
alleys.</p>

<p>How many hundred thousands were expended
upon the new Blenheim palace, built in Anne’s time,
I will not undertake to compute. The paintings
gathered in it&mdash;spoils of the great Duke’s military
marches&mdash;interest everyone; but the palace
is as cold and stately and unhome-like and unloveable
as was the Duchess herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<h3>Builders and Streets.</h3>

<p>Sir John Vanbrugh<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> was the architect of Blenheim,
and you will recognize his name as that of
one of the popular comedy writers of Queen Anne’s
time, who not only wrote plays, but ran a theatre
which he built at the Haymarket. It was not so
successful as the more famous one which stands
thereabout now; the poor architect, too, had a
good many buffets from the stinging Duchess of
Marlborough; and some stings besides from Swift’s
waspish pen, which the amiable Duchess did not
allow him to forget.</p>

<p>Another architect of these times, better worth
our remembering&mdash;for his constructive abilities&mdash;was
Sir Christopher Wren, who designed some
forty of the church-spires now standing in London;
and he also superintended the construction of the
Cathedral of St. Paul’s, which had been steadily
growing since a date not long after the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
fire&mdash;thirty-five years intervening between the laying
of the foundations and the lifting of the cross to
the top of the lantern. It is even said that, when
he was well upon ninety, Wren supervised some of
the last touches upon this noble monument to his
fame.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>There was not so much smoke in London in
those days&mdash;the consumption of coal being much
more limited&mdash;and the great cross could be seen
from Notting Hill, and from the palace windows at
Kensington. The Queen never abandoned this
royal residence; and from the gravel road by which
immediate entrance was made, stretched away the
waste hunting ground, afterward converted into
the grassy slopes of Hyde Park&mdash;stagnant pools
and marshy thickets lying in place of what is now
the Serpentine. People living at Reading in that
day&mdash;whence ladies now come in for a morning’s
shopping and back to lunch&mdash;did then, in seasons
of heaviest travelling, put two days to the journey;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and joined teams, and joined forces and outriders,
to make good security against the highwaymen
that infested the great roads leading from that
direction into the town. Queen Anne herself was
beset and robbed near to Kew shortly before she
came to the throne; and along Edgeware Road,
where are now long lines of haberdasher shops,
and miles of gas-lamps, were gibbets, on which the
captured and executed highwaymen were hung up
in warning.</p>

<h3>John Gay.</h3>

<p>Some of these highwaymen were hung up in literature
too, and made a figure there; but not, I
suspect, in way of warning. It was the witty Dean
Swift who suggested to the brisk and frolicsome
poet, John Gay, that these gentlemen of the high-road
would come well into a pastoral or a comedy;
and out of that suggestion came, some years later,
“The Beggar’s Opera,” with Captain Macheath for
a hero, that took the town by storm&mdash;ran for sixty
and more successive nights, and put its musical,
saucy songlets afloat in all the purlieus of London.
It was, indeed, the great forerunner of our ballad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
operas; much fuller, indeed, of grime and foul
strokes than Mr. Gilbert’s contagious sing-song;
but possessing very much of his briskness and
quaint turns of thought, and of that pretty shimmer
of language which lends itself to melody as
easily as the thrushes do.</p>

<p>This John Gay<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>&mdash;whose name literary-mongers
will come upon in their anthologies&mdash;was an
alert, well-looking young fellow, who had come out
of Devonshire to make his way in a silk-mercer’s
shop in London. He speedily left the silk-mercer’s;
but he had that about him of joyousness
and amiability, added to a clever but small literary
faculty, which won the consideration of helpful
friends; and he never lost friends by his antagonisms
or his moodiness. Everybody seemed to love
to say a good word for John Gay. Swift was almost
kind to him; and said he was born to be always
twenty-two, and no older. Pope befriended
and commended him; great ladies petted him; and
neither Swift nor Pope were jealous of a petting
to such as Gay; his range was amongst the daisies&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
theirs&mdash;above the tree-tops. A little descriptive
poem of his, called <cite>Trivia</cite>, brings before
us the London streets of that day&mdash;the coaches,
the boot-blacks, the red-heeled cavaliers, the book-stalls,
the markets, the school-boys, the mud, the
swinging sign-boards, and the tavern-doors. In
the course of it he gives a score or more of lines
to a description of the phenomena of the solidly
frozen Thames&mdash;sharply remembered by a good
many living in his time<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>&mdash;with booths all along
the river, and bullocks cooked upon the frozen
roads which bridged the water; and he tells of an
old apple-woman, who somehow had her head
lopped off when the break-up came, and the ice-cakes
piled above the level&mdash;tells it, too, in a very
Gilbert-like way, as you shall see:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“She now a basket bore;</div>
<div class="verse">That head alas! shall basket bear no more!</div>
<div class="verse">Each booth she frequent past, in quest of gain,</div>
<div class="verse">And boys with pleasure heard her thrilling strain.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Ah, Doll! all mortals must resign their breath,</div>
<div class="verse">And industry itself submit to Death;</div>
<div class="verse">The cracking crystal yields; she sinks; she dies,</div>
<div class="verse">Her head chopt off, from her lost shoulder flies;</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Pippins!</em> she cry’d; but death her voice confounds;</div>
<div class="verse">And&mdash;<em>Pip</em>&mdash;<em>Pip</em>&mdash;<em>Pip</em>&mdash;along the ice resounds!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then there is the ballad, always quoted when
critics would show what John Gay could do, and
which the Duchess of Queensberry (who greatly
befriended him) thought charming; I give the
two final verselets only:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“How can they say that nature</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Has nothing made in vain;</div>
<div class="verse">Why then beneath the water</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Should hideous rocks remain?</div>
<div class="verse">No eyes the rocks discover,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That lurk beneath the deep,</div>
<div class="verse">To wreck the wandering lover,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And leave the maid to weep?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“All melancholy lying,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Thus wailed she for her dear;</div>
<div class="verse">Repaid each blast with sighing,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Each billow with a tear;</div>
<div class="verse">When o’er the white wave stooping,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">His floating corpse she spied;</div>
<div class="verse">Then, like a lily drooping,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">She bowed her head, and died!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>
<p>I think I have shown the best side of him; and
it is not very imposing. A man to be petted; one
for confections and for valentines, rather than for
those lifts of poetic thought which buoy us into
the regions of enduring song.</p>

<p>Yet Swift says in a letter, “‘The Beggar’s Opera’
hath knocked down Gulliver!” This joyous poet
lies in Westminster Abbey, with an epitaph by
Alexander Pope. How, then, can we pass him by?</p>

<h3>Jonathan Swift.</h3>

<p>But Dean Swift<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> does not lie in Westminster
Abbey. We must go to St. Patrick’s Cathedral,
Dublin, to find his tomb, and that bust of him
which looks out upon the main aisle of the old
church.</p>

<p>He was born in Dublin, at a house that might
have been seen only a few years ago, in Hoey’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Court. His father, however, was English, dying
before Swift was born; his mother, too, was English,
and so poor that it was only through the charity
of an uncle the lad came to have schooling and
a place at Trinity College&mdash;the charity being so
doled out that Swift groaned under it; and groaned
under the memory of it all his life. He took his
degree there, under difficulties; squabbling with
the teachers of logic and metaphysics, and turning
his back upon them and upon what they taught.</p>

<p>After some brief stay with his mother in Leicestershire,
he goes, at her instance, and in recognition of
certain remote kinship with the family of Sir William
Temple, to seek that diplomat’s patronage. He
was received charitably&mdash;to be cordial was not
Temple’s manner&mdash;at the beautiful home of
Sheen;<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and thereafter, on Temple’s change of residence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
was for many years an inmate of the house
at Moor Park. There he eats the bread of dependence&mdash;sulkily
at times, and grudgingly always.
Another <i lang="fr">protégée</i> of the house was a sparkling-eyed
little girl, Hester Johnson&mdash;she scarce ten when
he was twenty-three&mdash;and who, doubtless, looked
admiringly upon the keen, growling, masculine
graduate of Dublin, who taught her to write.</p>

<p>Swift becomes secretary to Sir William; through
his influence secures a degree at Oxford (1692);
pushes forward his studies, with the Moor Park
library at his hand; takes his own measure&mdash;we
may be sure&mdash;of the stately, fine diplomat; measures
King William too&mdash;who, odd times, visits
Temple at his country home, telling him how to
cut his asparagus&mdash;measures him admiringly, yet
scornfully; as hard-working, subtle-thoughted, ambitious,
dependent students are apt to measure
those whose consequence is inherited and factitious.</p>

<p>Then, with the bread of this Temple charity irking
his lusty manhood, he swears (he is overfond of
swearing) that he will do for himself. So he tempestuously
quits Moor Park and goes back to Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
where he takes orders, and has a little parish
with a stipend of £100 a year. It is in a dismal
country&mdash;looking east on the turbid Irish Sea, and
west on bog-lands&mdash;no friends, no scholars, no
poets, no diplomats, no Moor-Park gardens. Tired
of this waste, and with new and better proposals
from Temple&mdash;who misses his labors&mdash;Swift throws
up his curacy (or whatever it may be) and turns
again toward England.</p>

<p>There is record of a certain early flurry of feeling
at date of this departure from his first Irish
parish&mdash;a tender, yet incisive, and tumultuous
letter to one “Varina,”<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> for whom he promises to
“forego all;” Varina, it would seem, discounted
his imperious rapture, without wishing to cut off
ulterior hopes. But ulteriors were never in the lexicon
of Swift; and he broke away for his old
cover at Moor Park. Sir William welcomes, almost
with warmth, the returned secretary, who resumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
old studies and duties, putting a fiercer appetite
to his work, and a greater genius. Miss Hester is
there to be guided, too; she sixteen, and he fairly
turned among the thirties; she of an age to love
moonlight in the Moor Park gardens, and he of
an age&mdash;when do we have any other?&mdash;to love
tender worship.</p>

<p>But <cite>The Battle of the Books</cite><a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and <cite>The Tale of
a Tub</cite>, are even then seething and sweltering in
his thought. They are wonderful products both;
young people cannot warm to them as they do to
the men of Liliput and of Brobdingnag; but there
are old folk who love yet, in odd hours, to get
their faculties stirred by contact with the flashing
wit and tremendous satire of the books named.</p>

<p>The <cite>Battle</cite>&mdash;rather a pamphlet than a book&mdash;deals
with the antagonism, then noisy, between
advocates of ancient and modern learning, to
which Bentley, Wotton, and Temple were parties.
Swift strikes off heads all round the arena, but inclines
to the side of his patron, Temple; and in a
wonderful figure, of wonderful pertinence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
with witty appointments, he likens the moderns to
noisome spiders, spinning out of their own entrails
the viscous “mathematical” net-work, which catches
the vermin on which they feed; and contrasting
these with the bees (ancients), who seek natural and
purer sources of nutriment&mdash;storing “wax and
honey,” which are the sources of the “light and
sweetness of life.” There are horribly coarse
streaks in this satire, as there are in <cite>The Tale of a
Tub</cite>; but the wit is effulgent and trenchant.</p>

<p>In this latter book there is war on all pedantries
again; but mostly on shams in ecclesiastic teachings
and habitudes; Swift finding (as so many of us
do) all the shams, in practices which are not his
own. It is a mad, strange, often foul-mouthed
book, with thrusts in it that go to the very marrow
of all monstrous practices in all ecclesiasticisms;
showing a love for what is honest and of
good report, perhaps; but showing stronger love
for thwacking the skulls of all sinners in high
places; and the higher the place the harder is the
thwack.</p>

<p>Not long after these things were a-brewing,
Sir William Temple died (1699), bequeathing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
papers to his secretary. Swift looked for more.
So many wasted years! Want of money always
irked him. But he goes to London to see after
the publication of Temple’s papers. He has an interview
with King William&mdash;then in his last days&mdash;to
whom Temple had commended him, but no
good comes of that. He does, however, get place
as chaplain for Lord Berkeley; goes to Ireland
with him; reads good books to Lady Berkeley&mdash;among
them the <cite>Occasional Reflections of the Hon.
Robert Boyle</cite>, of whose long sentences I gave a taste
in an earlier chapter.</p>

<p>Some of these Boyle meditations were on the
drollest of topics&mdash;as, for instance, “Upon the
Sight of a Windmill Standing Still,” and again,
“Upon the Paring of a rare Summer Apple.”</p>

<p>Swift had no great appetite for such “parings;”
but Lady Berkeley being insatiate, he slips a meditation
of his own, in manuscript, between the leaves
of the great folio of the Hon. Mr. Boyle; and opening
to the very place begins reading, for her edification,
“Meditations on a Broomstick.” “Dear
me!” says her ladyship, “what a strange subject!
But there is no knowing what useful instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
this wonderful man may draw from topics the
most trivial. Pray, read on, Mr. Swift.”</p>

<p>And he did. He was not a man given to smiles
when a joke was smouldering; and he went through
his meditation with as much unction as if the Hon.
Robert had written it. The good lady kept her
eyes reverently turned up, and never smacked the
joke until it came out in full family conclave.</p>

<p>I have told this old story (which, like most good
stories, some critics count apocryphal) because it is
so like Swift; he had such keen sense of the ridiculous,
that he ran like a hound in quest of it&mdash;having
not only a hound’s scent but a hound’s teeth.</p>

<p>At Laracor, the little Irish parish which he came
by shortly after, he had a glebe and a horse, and
became in a way domesticated there, so far as such
a man could be domesticated anywhere. He duplicated,
after a fashion, some features of the Moor-Park
gardens; he wrote sermons there which are
surprisingly good.</p>

<p>One wonders, as he comes from toiling through
the sweat and muck and irreverent satire of <cite>The
Tale of a Tub</cite>, what could have possessed the man
to write so piously. He was used to open his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
sermons with a little prayer that was devout enough
and all-embracing enough for the prayer-book.
Then there is a letter of his to a young clergyman,
giving advice about the make-up of his sermons,
which would serve for an excellent week-day discourse
at Marquand Chapel.</p>

<p>Indeed he has somewhat to say against the use
of “hard words&mdash;called by the better sort of vulgar,
fine language”&mdash;that is worth repeating:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will appeal to any man of letters whether at least
nineteen or twenty of these perplexing words might not be
changed into easy ones, such as naturally first occur to ordinary
men; … the fault is nine times in ten owing
to affectation, and not want of understanding. When a
man’s thoughts are clear, the properest words will generally
offer themselves first, and his own judgment will direct
him in what order to place them, so as they may be best
understood. In short, that simplicity, without which no
human performance can arrive to any great perfection, is
nowhere more eminently useful than in this.”</p>

</div>

<p>But let us not suppose from all this that Swift
has settled down tamely, and month by month, into
the jog-trot duties of a small Irish vicar; no, no!
there is no quiet element in his nature. He has
gone back and forth from Dublin to London&mdash;sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
on a Berkeley errand&mdash;sometimes on
his own. He has met Congreve, an old school-fellow,
and Prior and Gay; he has found the way
to Will’s Coffee-house and to Button’s;<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> has some
day seen Dryden&mdash;just tottering to the grave;
has certainly dined with Addison, and finished a
bottle with Steele. They call him the mad parson
at Button’s; they have seen <cite>The Tale of a
Tub</cite>; his epigrams are floating from mouth to
mouth; his irony cuts like a tiger’s claw; he
feels the power of his genius tingling to his fingertips&mdash;<em>he</em>,
a poor Irish parson! why, the whole atmosphere
around him, whether at London or at
Dublin, is charged and surcharged with Satan’s
own lightning of worldly promises.</p>

<p>And Hester Johnson, and Moor Park? Well, she
has not forgotten him; ah! no; and he has by no
means forgotten her. For she, with a good womanly
friend, Mrs. Dingley, has gone to live in Ireland;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Swift thinks they can live more economically
there. These two ladies set up their homestead
near to Swift’s vicarage; he goes to see them;
they come to see him. He is thirty-three, and
past; and she twenty, and described as beautiful.
Is there any scandalous talking? Scarce one word,
it would seem. He is as considerate as ice; and
she as coy as summer clouds.</p>

<p>It does not appear that Swift had literary ambition,
as commonly reckoned. That <cite>Tale of a Tub</cite>
lay by him six or seven years before it came to
print. He wrote for Steele’s <cite>Tatler</cite>, and for the
<cite>Spectator</cite>&mdash;not with any understanding that his
name was to appear, or that he was to be spoken
admiringly of. Many of his best things were addressed
to friends or acquaintances, and never saw
the light through any instigation or privity of his
own.</p>

<p>When there was some purpose to effect&mdash;some
wrong to lash&mdash;some puppet to knock down&mdash;some
tow-head to set on fire&mdash;some public drowsiness
to wake&mdash;he rushed into print with a vengeance.
Was it benevolence that provoked him to
this? was it public spirit? Who can tell? I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
there were many times when he thought as much;
but I believe that never a man more often deceived
himself than did Swift; and that over and over he
mistook the incentives of his own fiery and smarting
spirit for the leadings of an angel of light.</p>

<p>When we think of the infrequency and awkwardness
of travel in that day, we are not a little
amazed to find him going back and forth as he did
from Ireland to London. The journey was not, as
now, a mere skip over to Holyhead, and then a five
hours’ whirl to town, but a long, uncertain sail in
some lugger of a vessel&mdash;blown as the winds blew&mdash;till
a landing was made at Bristol or Swansea;
and then the four to seven days of coaching (as the
roads might be) through Bath to London. Sometimes
it is some interest of the poor Irish Church
that takes him over, for which we must give him
due credit; but oftener it is his own unrest. His
energies and his unsatisfied mind starve if not
roused and bolstered and chafed by contact with
minds as keen and hard, from which will come
the fiery disputation that he loves. Great cities,
where great interests are astir and great schemes
fomenting, are magnets whose drawing power such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
intellects cannot resist. He is in London five or
six months in 1701, six or eight the next year, six
or eight the next, and so on.</p>

<h3>Swift’s Politics.</h3>

<p>He is in politics, too, which ran at high tide all
through Anne’s time and the previous reign; you
will read no history or biography stretching into
that period but you may be confounded (at least I
am) with talk of Whigs and Tories; and of what
Somers did, and of what Harley did, and of what
Ormond might do; and it is worth sparing a few
moments to say something of the great parties.
In a large way Whiggism represented progress and
the new impulses which had come in with William
III., and Toryism represented what we call conservatism.
Thus, in <cite>Old Mortality</cite>, young Henry Morton
is the Whig, and her ladyship of Tillietudlem
is a starched embodiment of Toryism. Those
who favored the Stuart family, and made a martyr
of Charles I.&mdash;those who leaned to Romanism and
rituals, or faith in tradition, were, in general,
Tories; and those who brought over William of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Orange, or who were dissenters or freethinkers,
were apt to be Whigs. So the scars which came
of sword-cuts by Cromwellian soldiers were apt to
mark an excellent Tory; and the cropped ears of
Puritans, that told of the savageness of Prince Rupert’s
dragoons, were pretty sure to brand a man a
Whig for life. But these distinctions were not
steady and constant; thus, the elegant and fastidious
Sir William Temple was a Whig; and old Dryden,
clinking mugs with good fellows at Will’s
coffee-house, was a Tory. Again, the courtly and
quiet Mr. Addison, with his De Coverley reverences,
was a good Whig; and Pope, with his <cite>Essay on
Man</cite>, and fellowship with freethinkers, was Toryish.
Swift began with being a Whig, to which side his
slapdash wilfulness, his fellowship with Temple,
and his scorn of tradition drew him; but he ended
with veering over to the Tory ranks, where his
hate of Presbyterianism and his eager thrusts at
canting radicals gave him credit and vogue.</p>

<p>Addison and others counted him a turncoat, and
grew cold to him; for party hates were most hot in
those days; Swift himself says&mdash;the politicians
wrangle like cats. He was tired, too, of waiting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Whig promises; perhaps he had larger hope of preferment
with the Tories; Steele alleged this with
bitterness; and there can be no doubt that Swift
had an eye on preferment. Why not? Can he, so
alert in mind, so loving of dignity, so conscious of
power, see Mr. Addison coming to place as Secretary
of State, and Steele with his fat commissions,
without a tingling and irritating sense of dissatisfaction?
Can he see good, amiable, pious dunces
getting planted year after year in fat bishoprics,
without a torturing remembrance of that poor little
parish of Laracor, with a following so feeble that
he is fain to open service some days (his factotum
being the only auditor) with&mdash;“My dearly beloved
Roger, the Scripture moveth you and me in sundry
places&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>How these contrasts must have grated on the
mind of a man who looked down on all their lordships;
who looked down on Steele; and who could
count on his finger-ends the personages whom he
scanned eye to eye&mdash;and who were upon a level
with his commanding height.</p>

<p>He did service, too&mdash;this master of the pen and
master of causticity&mdash;that to most would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
brought quick reward; but he was too strong and
too proud and too independent to come by reward
easily. Such a man is bowed to reverently; is invited
to dine hither and yon; is flattered, is humored,
is conciliated; but as for office&mdash;ah! that
is another matter. He is unsafe; he will kick over
the traces; he will take the bit in his mouth; he
will be his own man and not our man. What
court, what cabinet, what clique could trust to the
moderation, to the docility, to the reticence of a
person capable of writing <cite>Gulliver’s Travels</cite>, and of
turning all court scandals, all political intrigues, all
ecclesiastic decorum, into a penny-show?</p>

<p>He is, indeed, urged for Bishop of Hereford&mdash;seems
to have excellent chance there; but some
brother Bishop (I think ’tis the Archbishop of
York), who is much afraid, as he deserves to be,
of <cite>The Tale of a Tub</cite>&mdash;says to the hesitating Queen,&mdash;“Better
inquire first if this man be really a
Christian;” and this frights the good Queen and
the rest. So Swift is let off with the poor sop of
the Deanery of St. Patrick’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<h3>His London Journal.</h3>

<p>We know all about those days of his in London&mdash;days
of expectancy. He has told us:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The ministry are good hearty fellows. I use them like
dogs, because I expect they will use me so. They call me
nothing but Jonathan. I said I believed they would leave
me Jonathan, as they found me; and that I never knew a
minister do anything for those whom they make companions
of their pleasures; and I believe you will find it so, but <em>I</em>
care not.”</p>

</div>

<p>And to whom does he talk so confidentially, and
tell all the story of those days? Why, to Hester
Johnson. It is all down in Stella’s journal&mdash;written
for her eye only; and we have it by purest accident.
It was begun in 1710&mdash;he then in his
forty-third year, and she in her thirtieth.</p>

<p>She has kept her home over in Ireland with Mrs.
Dingley&mdash;seeing him on every visit there, and on
every day, almost, of such visits; and, as her sweetest
pasturage, feeding on letters he writes other
times, and lastly on this Stella journal, “for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
dear eyes,” at the rate of a page, or even two pages
a day, for some three years.</p>

<p>All his London day’s life comes into it. Let us
listen:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Dined at the chop-house with Will Pate, the learned
woollen draper, then we sauntered at china-shops and book-sellers;
went to the tavern; drank 2 pints of white wine;
never parted till ten. Have a care of those eyes&mdash;pray&mdash;pray,
pretty Stella!</p>

<p>“So you have a fire now, and are at cards at home; I
think of dining in my lodgings to-day on a chop and a pot
of ale.</p>

<p>“Shall I? Well, then, I will try to please M. D. [‘M.
D.’ is ‘my dear;’ or ‘my dears,’ when it includes, as it
often does, Mrs. Dingley]. I was to-night at Lord Masham’s;
Lord Dupplin took out my little pamphlet, the Secretary
read a good deal of it to Lord Treasurer; they all
commended it to the skies; so did I.</p>

<p>“I’ll answer your letter to-morrow; good night, M. D.
Sleep well.”</p>

</div>

<p>Again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have no gilt paper left, so you must be content with
plain. I dined with Lord Treasurer.</p>

<p>“A poem is out to-day inscribed to me: a Whiggish
poem and good for nothing. They teased me with it.”</p>

<p>“I am not yet rid of my cold. No news to tell you:
went to dine with Mrs. Vanhomrigh, a neighbor. [Then
a long political tale, and] Good night, my dear little
rogues.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>’Tis a strange journal; such a mingling of court
gossip, sharp political thrusts, lover-like, childish
prattle, and personal details. If he is sick, he
scores down symptoms and curatives as boldly as a
hospital nurse; if he lunches at a chop-house, he
tells cost; if he takes in his waistcoat, he tells
Stella of it; if he dines with Addison, he tells how
much wine they drank; if a street beggar or the
Queen shed tears, they slop down into that Stella
journal; if she wants eggs and bacon, he tells
where to buy and what to give; if Lady Dalkeith
paints, he sees it with those great, protuberant eyes
of his, and tells Stella.</p>

<p>There is coarseness in it, homeliness, indelicacies,
wit, sharp hits, dreary twaddle, and repeated good-nights
to his beloved M. D.’s, and&mdash;to take care
of themselves, and eat the apples at Laracor, and
wait for him. No&mdash;I mistake; I don’t think he
ever says with definiteness Stella must wait for
him. I should say (without looking critically over
the journal to that end) that he cautiously
avoided so positive a committal. And she?&mdash;ah!
she, poor girl, waits without the asking. And
those indelicacies and that coarseness? Well, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
strange, great man can do nothing wrong in her
eyes.</p>

<p>But she does see that those dinings at a certain
Mrs. Vanhomrigh’s come in oftener and oftener.
’Tis a delightfully near neighbor, and her instinct
scents something in the wind. She ventures a
question, and gets a stormy frown glowering over
a page of the journal that puts her to silence.
The truth is, Mrs. Vanhomrigh<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> has a daughter&mdash;young,
clever, romantic, not without personal
charms, who is captivated by the intellect of Mr.
Swift; all the more when he volunteers direction
of her studies, and leads her down the flowery
walks of poetry under his stalwart guidance.</p>

<p>Then the suspicious entries appear more thickly
in the journal. “Dined with Mrs. Vanhomrigh”&mdash;and
again: “Stormy, dined with a neighbor”&mdash;“couldn’t
go to court, so went to the
Vans.” And thus this romance went on ripening
to the proportions that are set down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
poem of “Cadenus and Vanessa.” He is old, she
is young.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Vanessa, not in years a score,</div>
<div class="verse">Dreams of a gown of forty-four;</div>
<div class="verse">Imaginary charms can find</div>

<div class="verse">Cadenus, common forms apart,</div>

<div class="verse">Had sigh’d and languished, vowed and writ,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But this wit has made conquest of her; she</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“&mdash;&mdash;called for his poetic works:</div>
<div class="verse">[Cupid] meantime in secret lurks;</div>
<div class="verse">And, while the book was in her hand,</div>

<div class="verse">A dart of such prodigious length,</div>
<div class="verse">It pierced the feeble volume through,</div>
<div class="verse">And deep transfixed her bosom too.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is part of his story of it, which he put in her
hands for her reading;<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and which, like the Stella<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
journal, only saw the light after the woman most
interested in it was in the ground.</p>

<h3>In Ireland Again.</h3>

<p>Well, Swift at last goes back to Ireland&mdash;all his
larger designs having miscarried&mdash;a saddened and
disappointed man; full of growlings and impatience;
taking with him from that wreck of London
life and political forgatherings, only the poor flotsam
of an Irish deanery.</p>

<p>He has some few friends to welcome him there:
Miss Hester and Mrs. Dingley among the rest. How
gladly would Stella have put all her woman’s art
and her womanly affection to the work of cheering
and making glad the embittered and disappointed
Dean: but no; he has no notion of being handicapped
by marriage; he is sterner, narrower, more
misanthropic than ever. All the old severe proprieties
and distance govern their intercourse. He
visits them betimes and listens to their adulatory
prattle; they, too, come up to the deanery when
there are friends to entertain; often take possession
when the Dean is away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>The church dignitaries are not open-handed in
their advances; the <cite>Tale of a Tub</cite>, and stories
of that London life (not much of it amongst
churches) have put a wall between them and the
Dean. But he interests himself in certain questions
of taxation and of currency, which seem of
vital importance to the common people; and he
wins, by an influence due to his sharp pamphleteering,
what they count a great relief from their dangers
or burdens. Thus he becomes a street idol,
and crowds throw up their caps for this doctor
militant, whom they call the good Dean. He has
his private large charities, too; there are old
women, decrepit and infirm, whom he supports year
after year; does this&mdash;Swift-like&mdash;when he will
haggle a half hour about the difference of a few
pennies in the price for a bottle of wine, and will
serve his clerical friends with the lees of the last
dinner: strange, and only himself in everything.</p>

<p>Then Miss Vanhomrigh&mdash;after the death of her
mother&mdash;must needs come over&mdash;to the great
perplexity of the Doctor&mdash;to a little country place
which she has inherited in the pretty valley of the
Liffey&mdash;a short drive away from Dublin; she has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
fine house there, and beautiful gardens (Swift never
outgrew his old Moor-Park love for gardens); there
she receives him, and honors his visits. An old
gardener, who was alive in Scott’s time, told how
they planted a laurel bush whenever the Dean came.
Perhaps the Dean was too blinded for fine reading
in the garden alleys then; certainly his fierce headaches
were shaking him year by year nearer to the
grave.</p>

<p>Miss Hester comes to a knowledge of these visits,
and is tortured, but silent. Has she a right to
nurse torture? Some biographers say that at her
urgence a form of marriage was solemnized between
them (1716); but if so, it was undeclared and unregarded.
Vanessa, too, has her tortures; she has
knowledge of Stella and her friend, and of their attitude
with respect to the deanery; so, in a moment
of high, impetuous daring, she writes off to
Mistress Hester Johnson asking what rights she has
over her friend the Dean? Poor Stella wilts at this
blow; but is stirred to an angry woman’s reply,
making (it is said) avowal of the secret marriage.
To the Dean, who is away, she encloses Vanessa’s
letter; and the Dean comes storming back; rages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
across the country, carrying to Miss Vanhomrigh
her own letter&mdash;flings it upon the table before
her, with that look of blackness that has made
duchesses tremble&mdash;turns upon his heel, and sees
her no more.</p>

<p>In a fortnight, or thereabout, Poor Vanessa was
dead. It was a fever they said; may be; certainly,
if a fever, there were no hopes in her life now
which could make great head against it. She
changed her will before her death, cutting off
Swift, who was sole legatee, and leaving one-half to
Bishop Berkeley; through whom, strangely enough,
Yale College may be said to inherit a part of poor
Vanessa’s fortune.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Such a blow, by its side bruises, must needs
scathe somewhat the wretched Hester Johnson;
but time brought a little healing in its wings. The
old kindliness and friendship that dated from the
pleasant walks in Moor Park, came back&mdash;as rosy
twilights will sometimes shoot kindly gleams between
stormy days, and the blackness of night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
And Swift, I think, never came nearer to insupportable
grief than when he heard&mdash;on an absence in
London, a few years thereafter&mdash;that Stella was
dying week by week.</p>

<p>“Poor Stella,” “dear Stella,” “poor soul,” break
into his letters&mdash;break, doubtless, into his speech
on solitary walks; but in others’ presence his dignity
and coldness are all assured. There is rarely
breakdown where man or woman can see him.
Old Dr. Sheridan<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> says that at the last she appealed
to him to declare and make public their private
marriage; whereat he “turned short away.”
A more probable story is that in those last days
Swift himself proposed public declaration, to which
the dying woman could only wave a reply&mdash;“too
late!”</p>

<p>She died in 1728: he in the sixty-second year of
his age, and she forty-eight.</p>

<p>He would have written about her the night she
died; had the curtains drawn that he might not see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
the light where her body lay; but he broke down
in the writing. They brought a lock of her hair to
him. It was found many years after in an old envelope,
worn with handling, with this inscription on
it&mdash;in his hand&mdash;<cite>Only a woman’s hair</cite>.</p>

<p>I have not much more to say of Dean Swift,
whose long story has kept us away from gentler
characters, and from verses more shining than his.
Indeed, I do not think the poems of Swift are much
read nowadays; surely none but a strong man
and a witty one could have written them; but they
do not allure us. Everybody, however, remembers
with interest the little people that Lemuel Gulliver
saw, and will always associate them with the name
of Swift. But if the stormy Dean had known that
his Gulliver book would be mostly relished by
young folks, only for its story, and that its tremendous
satire&mdash;which he intended should cut
and draw blood&mdash;would have only rarest appreciation,
how he would have raved and sworn!</p>

<p>They tell us he had private prayers for his household,
and in secluded places; and there are those
who sneer at this&mdash;“as if a Dean should say
prayers in a crypt!” But shall we utterly condemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the poor Publican who&mdash;though he sells drams
and keeps selling them&mdash;smites his bosom <em>afar
off</em> and cries, God be merciful!&mdash;as if there
were a bottom somewhere that might be reached,
and stirred, and sparkle up with effervescence of
hope and truth and purity? He was a man, I
think, who would have infinitely scorned and revolted
at many of the apologies that have been
made for him. To most of these he would have
said, in his stentorian way, “I am what I am; no
rosy after-lights can alter this shape of imperfect
manhood; wrong, God knows; who is not? But a
prevaricator&mdash;pretending feeling that is not real&mdash;offering
friendship that means nothing&mdash;proffering
gentle words, for hire; never, never!”</p>

<p>And in that great Court of Justice&mdash;which I am
old-fashioned enough to believe will one day be
held&mdash;where juries will not be packed, and where
truth will shine by its own light, withstanding all
perversion&mdash;and where opportunities and accomplishment
will be weighed in even scales against
possible hindrances of moral or of physical make-up&mdash;there
will show, I am inclined to think, in the
strange individuality of Swift, a glimmer of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
finer and higher traits of Character than we are
accustomed to assign him.</p>

<p>After Stella’s death he wrote little:<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> perhaps he
furbished up the closing parts of <cite>Gulliver</cite>; there
were letters to John Gay, light and gossipy; and to
Pope, weightier and spicier.</p>

<p>But the great tree was dying at the top. He
grew stingier and sterner, and broke into wild
spasms of impatience, such as only a diseased brain
could excuse and explain. His loneliness became a
more and more fearful thing to be borne; but who
shall live with this half-mad man of gloom?</p>

<p>At length it is only a hired keeper who can abide
with him: yet still he is reckless, proud, defiant,
merciless, with no words coming to his fagged
brain whereby he may express his thought; having
thoughts, but they were bitter ones; having penitences
maybe, but very vain ones; having remorses&mdash;ah,
what abounding ones!</p>

<p>Finally he has no longer the power, if the grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
were in him, to ask pardon of the humanity he has
wronged; or to tell of the laments&mdash;if at that stage
he entertained them&mdash;over the grave of thwarted
purposes and of shattered hopes; condemned to
that imbecile silence which overtook him at last,
and held him four weary years in fool’s grasp,
suffering and making blundering unintelligible
moans.</p>

<p>He died in 1745&mdash;twenty-two years after Vanessa’s
death&mdash;seventeen years after the death of
Stella.</p>

The hour for opening in Elizabeth’s time was usually one

hour; and doubtless there were occasions when&mdash;in the private
theatres&mdash;plays began after nightfall. Fletcher and
Shakespeare were at the head of what was called the Lord

it was the prevailing custom of the Christians <em>in the
East</em>, from the beginning to pray the Lord’s Prayer, with the
Doxology.” It certainly appears in earliest Syriac version

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The allusion is to the Harts, whose ancestress was Shakespeare’s
sister Joan. A monumental record in Trinity
Church, Stratford, reads thus: “In memory of Thomas
Hart, who was the fifth descendant in a direct line from
Joan, eldest daughter of John Shakespeare. He died May
23, 1793.”</p>

<p>A son of the above Thomas Hart “followed the business
of a butcher at Stratford, where he was living in 1794.”
Still another Thomas Hart (eighth in descent from Joan) is
said to be now living in Australia&mdash;the only male representive
of that branch of the family.</p>

undoubted; nor are intimate friendly relations doubted;
but the further supposition&mdash;long accredited&mdash;that the major
part of the Sonnets were addressed to the same Earl&mdash;is
now generally abandoned&mdash;entirely so by the new Shakespearean
scholars. William Herbert (Earl of Pembroke)&mdash;to
whom is dedicated the 1623 folio&mdash;is counted by many
the “begetter” of these, and the rival of the poet in loves of
the “dark-eyed” frail one, whose identity has so provoked
inquiry.</p>

the Rev. Fred. Fitton, has latterly made himself advocate.

(though somewhat antiquated) in Dr. Drake’s interesting discussion
of <cite>Shakespeare and his Times</cite>. I name this book, not
as wholly authoritative, or comparable with the mass of
newer criticism which has been developed under the auspices
of the different Shakespeare societies, but as massing
together a great budget of information from cotemporaneous
authors and full of entertaining reading. In America, the

Years after, when Swift came by better church appointments,
Varina wrote to him a letter calculated to fan the flame of a
constant lover; but she received such reply&mdash;at once
disdainful and acquiescent&mdash;as was met only with contemptuous
silence.</p>

Vanessa’s.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2>START: FULL LICENSE<br />
<br />
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
